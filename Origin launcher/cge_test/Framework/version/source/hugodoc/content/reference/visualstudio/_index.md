This section covers features that can be used to adjust and modify how visual studio projects are generated by Framework.

<a name="Section1"></a>
## Overview ##

One of the goals of Framework has been to allow users to write there build script once and have build targets work the same regardless of the platform.
However, there are some cases where users have expressed a desire to override Frameworks default behavior when generating visual studio solutions
and allow them to modify the way the project is generated more directly.

The topics in this section cover properties that directly control certain aspects of the visual studio project generation process.
