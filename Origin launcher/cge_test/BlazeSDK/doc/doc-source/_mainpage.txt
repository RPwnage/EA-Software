%Blaze SDK is a cross-platform SDK for online game features. The SDK is still under construction and not all features intended are included in this documentation. If the features you are looking for are not present, please check with GS Production for the latest feature roadmap and delivery schedule.

\section _section_Orientation Orientation to the Blaze SDK API documentation

The <b> "Modules" </b> navigation section provides structure to the SDK documentation and is the recommended starting point for browsing this documentation. In constrast, the "Class List", "Namespace List", "File List" and "Directories" navigation provides a convenient way to locate a specific portion of the SDK. Please note that the "[code]" view of the file can be a better way to browse the header files than directly using the files since this view has the Doxygen tags removed.
    
Developers new to the %Blaze SDK should start with the <b> \ref _mod_structure "Organization of the Blaze SDK" </b> to see information about the structure of the SDK and the terminology used.

\section _section_BlazeOverview Blaze Overview

The %Blaze SDK is the client-side SDK for the %Blaze project, an effort intended in the long-term to fully replace both the currently Lobby SDK and Plasma SDK as well as the corresponding server infrastructure for each. The %Blaze project is focused on product stability and robustness as well as customization and extensibility. Standard, commonly-used features will be delivered by the GS development team, but %Blaze will also serve as a framework to allow for new development by GS customers. 

Both the %Blaze SDK and the %Blaze server is written in C++ to remove language barriers in development and provide building blocks for easier custom development. Note that even for customers who use the standard features, a certain amount of custom code in predefined areas of the %Blaze server is required to use specific features such as game summary reporting. 

%Blaze is also intended to minimize operating costs while still providing high scalability by operating on commodity hardware and using a lower cost database solution, MySQL. This approach also makes it easy for developers to run their own local %Blaze servers.

In addition to the %Blaze SDK, the %Blaze server is accessible via HTTP so that features and data are accessible from the web or mobile devices. All %Blaze component services are available directly via HTTP, but a later Web Access Layer will provide more convenient REST-style interfaces. Please contact GS Production if you are interested in more information regarding HTTP use of %Blaze.
