# List of symlink fix-ups (called by the rsync-fixed script).
# =============
#
# All paths are relative to "trunk" (or whatever "trunk" branch you're on).
#
# *Note: absolute directories are preserved because script uses pushd.
#
# version 1: (symlinking from the same directory)
# -------
# path/to/lib source.10.so target.so
#
# NOTE: The rsync-fixup script will add the libclntsh.so link by default
