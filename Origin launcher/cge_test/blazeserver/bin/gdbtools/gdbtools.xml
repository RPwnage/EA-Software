  <!-- gdbtools needs an object file but doing a compile isn't a straight forward as
       there isn't a task that takes care of it like the other build tasks (dependencies
       and all that). instead we just use the library task then just copy the object
       file that was generated. nice to have in the future would be a task that takes
       care of this without having to do the archive step. -->
