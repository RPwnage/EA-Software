            Modified the OnlinePass components IsSubscriber command (used for Season Ticket) to
            alwasy return true if Nucleus says the entitlement is active regarless of the timestamps
            as well as modify the GrantDate to start at the current time if it starts in the future
            within the next day. This is to address an issue where the Nucleus server clocks are
            running 6 minutes fast. The old implementation was checking the timestamps and returning
            that the user was  not a Season Ticket subscriber for 6 minutes immediatley after
            purchase.   Note: It should not be possible to purchase Season Ticket in the future.

            3.19.07 Blaze server upgrade changes

        custom code - game reporting


            A recent valgrind run showed a small leak in our processing of game reports for
            tournaments.  It appears to be the result of only deleting an allocated memory during
            early return calls or when an if statement is executed.  Moving outside of that if block
            should delete the memory always.
        ----
            didPlayerFinish() needs to be changed to protected scope so that game teams can
            implement custom logic
        ----
            Moving updateH2HSeasonalStats() to protected and making it virtual
        ----
            NCAA reported a memory growth in production that was tracked down to a game reporting
            issue where a variable was not being deleted and would leak.  The solution is on
            destruction, delete the memory if it is not NULL.
        ----
            There was a game reporting issue found where point dampening was taking place even if a
            user had never played their opponent before but DID play other players.  The incorrect
            map was being used to compare the list of previous game reports with our opponent ID,
            thereby using every game we played to impact dampening instead of just the games against
            a specific opponent for the calculation.

        custom component - clubs helper


            During a valgrind run it was exposed that there is a path where some memory is allocated
            but not de-allocated in the memberremoved clubs custom helper.
        ----
            EASW Free Agents were not being removed from the free agent list when joining a club.
            This was caused by not specifying the period type of the stats to check and was
            introduced when keyscopes were delivered by Blaze.  This is now fixed by passing in the
            appropriate period (all time) so the free agent is deleted.

        custom component - dynamic messaging


            The OSDKDynamicMessaging component does not currently add the title to the DB, thereby
            making it troublesome for teams or QA to add dynamic messages after a DB wipe.  I have
            fixed this by adding a config value in dynamicmessaging.cfg that will then be input into
            the lookup_titleId table in the dynamicmessaging database for reference from the
            messages table.
        ----
            Remove onReconfigure functionality from osdkdynamicmessaging component.
        ----
            Madden highlighted an issue where "SubscriptionThreshold" is not used from the config
            table. This does not cause an issue, just an annoying message in the log file. The fix
            is to remove the element from the database

        custom component - feedback


            Remove onReconfigure functionality from osdkfeedback component.

        custom component - live events


            A memory leak was found in a valgrind run and upon investigating it was found that we
            are clearing a hashtable but not deleting the underlying memory associated with it.
            While this only becomes an issue on shutdown, it should be cleaned up properly to ensure
            clean valgrind runs.
        ----
            Updating OSDKLiveEvents to remove onReconfigure functionality.  After analysis it was
            determined safest to not reload any settings associated with this component in the
            interests of stability balanced with convenience.

            SV_ENABLE_SERVER_VERSIONING=0
            
            SV_SERVER_VERSION=0
            
            SV_CLIENT_CHANGELIST=0
        ----
            Updating OSDKSettings to remove onReconfigure functionality.  After analysis it was
            determined safest to not reload any settings associated with this component in the
            interests of stability balanced with convenience.

        custom component - sponsored events


            GOS reported some OSDK components were spamming too many log entries in Fifa 13 and
            asked us to reduce the levels of some entries.  I have adjusted the components at the
            problematic locations to reduce log entries to TRACE level which will remove them from
            default conditions.
        ----
            Change OsdkSponsoredEvents component to only reconfig RegMailTemplate and
            RegMailParamList.

        ----
            Backing out previous ticker adjustments made in CL 407286 due to the nature of the

            similar checkin in soon with the correct adjustments for ticker.
        ----
            Updating OSDKTicker2 component to be more safe when executing onReconfigure calls in

        custom component - twitter


            Updating osdktwitter components onReconfigure calls to not re-initalize connection to
            twitter, and add some protections when altering the config after a reload.  This is a
            precaution against dangerous reloads in production.
        ----
            Madden demonstrated an issue when trying to log into twitter with empty username and
            password causing errors to appear in the log file. Changing a log message from ERR to
            TRACE, clears this issue

            The twitter cache was not being correctly updated when calling remove on it from a
            recent fix due to a compile error.  This fixes the compile error and makes the code
            consistent with all the other cache accesses in the twitterslaveimpl
        ----
            Fixed an issue found by madden where dissociating twitter credentials from the nucleus
            account left the credentials in the cache

        custom component - web offer survey


            Change OsdkWebOfferSurvey so it doesn't update DB cache in onReconfigure() because it is
            not safe and not necessary.

        facebook open graph


            *** DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED ***
            
            Added new Facebook Open Graph server config items.

        server configuration

            Added client/server version comparison parameters in osdk_core.cfg:
            SV_ENABLE_SERVER_VERSIONING=0
            SV_SERVER_VERSION=0
            SV_CLIENT_CHANGELIST=0
        ----
            Change Facebook Open Graph config to use Ping facebook/rs4 app.
        ----
            The DynamicMessaging DB for 2014 was not updated.  Corrected to point to new table.
        ----
            GOS informed us that one of the queries being used in OSDK is too expensive and with a
            full DB can create load issues.  The query is adjusted to use BETWEEN dates instead of
            using TIMESTAMPDIFF.
        ----
            Removing reloadable tags from config files which were accidentally checked in with
            previous CL.
        ----
            fixed a authentication component configuration issue where we did not set allowUnderage
            option correctly (diff platform should use diff setting).
        ----
            Fixed some defines issues in the boot files where the server will not startup if the
            server is configured to be a PC server.
        ----
            Fixed issue with max DNF matchmaking rule by renaming UED rule from "DNF_rule" to
            "OSDK_maxDNF".
        ----
            Adding myself to the email notification list for server issues.
        ----
            Pass a new parameter "isUnderage" to TOS weboffer URL to display different disclaimer
            for underage and of age accounts. This requires client CL141504 and editorial
            CL103382;103383;103392.
        ----
            First pass at updating V6.3 configs to V6.4

    Server

        build related


            Patching GOS Issue https://developer.origin.com/support/browse/GOSOPS-39298 where the
            TOS would expire after 24 hours thwarting new users' login attempts.
        ----
            Integration of 3.19.02.0 upgrade to ML line.
        ----
            Upgrade Blaze Server 3.19.03.0. Merging from UpgradeDL to ML
            from //gosdev/games/Ping/V6_3/Gen3/DL-BlazeUpgrade/...
            to //gosdev/games/Ping/V6_3/Gen3/ML/...
        ----
            Fixed a crashing issue in the server where mComponent of the clubs util can be NULL if
            the caller has not called to initialize the util class. Applied a GOS patch to use
            component instead of mComponent.

        custom code - clubs


            Allow seasonalplay RPCs to be called after a clubs game is complete. Fixes EASO-574 and
            EASO-629. [Regen your generated files]

        custom code - game reporting


            Pulling in a change from NHL to get the stats category for the game reporting slave,
            this can be used by custom code to provide the category for stat updates that are not
            handled by the parent classes
        ----
            Now update Game Common Report Win Player Stats with WLT_OPPOQCTAG (opponent quit and
            count tag) if win by DNF. This would correctly reflect DNF win.
        ----
            During destructor for for the otp game report, we were deleting a member that had
            already been deleted.  The solution is to remove the previous delete and keep the later
            run during the otp report destructor, since the GameClubReportSlave inherits from the
            GameOTPReportSlave.
        ----
            From FIFA Gen3 feedback - Fixed an issue in gameclubreportslave where the tie value is
            not set properly and mClubGameFinish is not initialized to true.
        ----
            Fix broken end-of-game mails in sample code. Reported by NHL at http://eac-easojira.eac.
            ad.ea.com/browse/EASO-717 .
        ----
            applied a GOS patch to the gamereporting master to enable observing reports for two
            disconnected users
        ----
            Set accountlocale keyscope value in game reporting. Fixes error when attempting to
            update stats for games. Fixes http://eac-easojira.eac.ad.ea.com/browse/OSDKV5-9393 .
        ----
            *** API UPDATE ***
            
            A few functions in GameClubReportSlave made protected so that they may be called from
            process() when overridden by a game team. See http://eac-easojira.eac.ad.ea.com/browse/
            EASOPARTNER-2834 .
            
            The following API is now protected (from private):
            void GameClubReportSlave::updateClubKeyscopes()
            bool GameClubReportSlave::updateClubStats()
            BlazeRpcError GameClubReportSlave::transformStats()

        custom component - arena


            Updating CERT boot to point to cert.virgingaming.com.
        ----
            Arena is now restricted to users under the age of 18 (in addition to being restricted to
            child accounts).
        ----
            increased the maximum length of a translated report within the osdkarena_reports table
            to 6K
        ----
            Changing the provider URL from demo.virgingaming.com to test.virgingaming.com in the
            TEST environment. Demo is Virgin's active development environment, and test is more
            stable.
        ----
            Adds platform and webDir to the Arena JSPs so that they may be customized by game teams.
        ----
            changed Arena weboffer URLs to use new EDITORIAL_BASE_URL (scheme, host and app) defined
            in osdk_*.boot
        ----
            Removing the obsolete flush queue setting from Arena. Changing some types from uint8_t (
            too small) to uint16_t.
        ----
            Fixed slow query in Arena found by stress testing against a populated database.
        ----
            fixed an issue that caused reports generated from two disconnected users not to be
            submitted to the Arena component
        ----
            Fixing Linux build break in OSDKArena game reporting hooks by adding new lines at the
            end of the file.
        ----
            This change contains two fixes in Arena that were developed in parallel:
            
            - Adds an OSDK custom game report master implementation, derived from
            Blaze::GameReporting::BasicGameReportMaster. It functions exactly the same as
            BasicGameReportMaster, but it catches the case where both users quit, and sends a DNF
            report to Virgin Gaming.
            
            - When adding the osdkarenaadmin user we now call the assignUserToGroup RPC instead of
            calling it locally in Framework. This ensures that the group assignment will be
            broadcast to all other slaves.
        ----
            cleaned up and added to standard arena command TRACE logging; provided more request
            information previously only available after encountering an error
        ----
            fixed getPendingChallenges such that unregistered users will still receive the 'not
            allowed' error before Arena has started
        ----
            Removes the stored procedure for retrieving pending challenges (instead, we use a
            prepared statement based off a static string in code). Blaze does not support calling
            stored procedures in a way that holds up to stress testing.
        ----
            added a new error to handle the case when a challenge is created between the same two
            entities
        ----
            We no longer error when a foreign key constraint check fails in OsdkArena.
        ----
            Updates the game reporting logic for OsdkArena to address issues found during stress
            testing. Now, we add the game report to the database immediately. We never flush the
            queue en masse to the database to avoid foreign key constraint errors.
        ----
            Removed use of the stored procedure in OSDKArena's getPendingChallenges RPC. This is to
            test the theory that database disconnects are caused by use of a stored procedure.

        custom component - espn feed


            Cache reaches 4GB in osdkespnfeed component

        custom component - seasonal play


            Fixed issue where message parameter of LogClubNewsUtil::logNews() was used as localized
            text. The message parameter should be used as string ID.
        ----
            Cache peirodIds in osdkseasonalplay so that rollovers can be triggered. Fixes EASO-1240.
        ----
            Fixes osdkseasonalplay rollovers by moving getPeriodIds RPC call into a scheduled fiber
            call. Fixes EASO-1240.
        ----
            Fixes stats not being tracked during regular season due to an error when updating
            seasonal stats. Fixes http://eac-easojira.eac.ad.ea.com/browse/OSDKV5-9567 .

        custom component - sponsored events


            removed mention of 'MLG' events from Sponsored Events - the new Arena component handles
            all communication with a third-party (which is now VirginGaming.com)

        custom component - ticker2


            Fixed an issue found by NCAA where configuring the stats ticker to off cause a crash in
            the stats ticker constructor. This was caused by not setting the mGameStatsTickerEnabled
            flag in the osdktickerconfighelper to accuratly mirror the contents of the config file
        ----
            Apply patch from GOS to allow osdkticker2 to get game reports while in aux slave.
            Related to https://developer.origin.com/support/browse/GOSOPS-35870 .
        ----
            Code changes necessary for patch from GOS to allow osdkticker2 to get game reports while
            in aux slave. Related to https://developer.origin.com/support/browse/GOSOPS-35870 .

        custom component - twitter


            Global variables are being overwritten as subsequent RPC calls spawn new fibers that
            execute the same function as previous calls.  When the sleeping fiber wakes up, it finds
            that the memory it was accessing has changed, resulting in memory out of bounds errors
            and crashing.  Moving dependent variables to the stack should solve this.
        ----
            Adding twitter error handling for a duplicate tweet posting.
        ----
            Implementing approximate rate limiting on twitter component and a lru cache for twitter
            credentials.  The objective is to make server more resilient to twitter bombardment.
        ----
            Allow osdktwitter component to send the characters [ " ! " , " ( " , " ) " , " \ " , " *
            " ]. This is by escaping them as per Twitter's API guidelines.
        ----
            Fix incorrect error reported to client when "associate with nucleus" is checked but
            invalid login information was given. Only attempt to save to nucleus upon valid login.

        custom component - web offer survey


            Fixed some osdkweboffersurvey DB table names cases.

        server configuration


            Fixing flow back to original intent of a retry if stale cache possible, along with a
            reset of the error code in case a retry attempt is successful.
        ----
            Fixing gamereporting config where we were fetching reports for a gamehistory query
            greater than an hour ago rather than within the last hour.  This results in a very
            expensive query on the server which can lead to DB timeouts.
        ----
            moved the OSDK_TOLLBOOTH_DDP_COMMERCE_ENABLED flag to only be defined for PS3 (since
            Microsoft has rejected the idea of DDP commerce)
        ----
            set the DDP_COMMERCE_ENABLED flag to 1 by default for PS3 within osdk_tollbooth.cfg
        ----
            Integrating from sandbox/acheng. Changes to support DDP->DDR conversion. Please see the
            integration guide at http://confluence.ea.com/display/EASS/DDP+Upgrade+to+DDR
        ----
            Downgrade of TelemetrySDK to 1.1.0 due to the Volcano line being depracated.
        ----
            Restore 'Scouting' club tool functionality. Fixes OSDKV5-9581.
        ----
            fixed a config issue where we forgot to add EASW server to Xbox name remap table.
        ----
            Removing trailing slash from EDITORIAL_BASE_URL in osdk_dev.boot. This was causing
            consoles to make requests for URLs with double slashes - eg. '//ping13/common/'.
        ----
            Use EDITORIAL_WEB_SCHEME constant in editorial urls defined osdk_x.cfg files.
        ----
            Change editorial server url to PING editorial dev in osdk_local.boot
        ----
            removed views associated with now-removed Sponsored Events 'mlg' event in rooms
        ----
            added support for a new EDITORIAL_WEB_SCHEME variable to customize support for http vs
            https per environment
        ----
            Change EDITORIAL_APP_NAME in osdk_xx.boot file. The RS4 server now supports multiple war
            applicatioin.
        ----
            Fixed the editorial server connection issue in secure mode
        ----
            For some reason the request to pg.ping13.dev.easportsworld.ea.com:8309 is not able to be
            forwarded to eac-swdev205.eac.ad.ea.com:10093.
            So use eac-swdev205.eac.ad.ea.com:10093 for now and will fix it when the network issue
            is resolved.
        ----
            Added 3 new variables for the new editorial server, and changed edtorial related urls
            using these new variables.
        ----
            Adds a definition of OSDK_arenaChallengeId to matchmaker.cfg so that the rule is
            included in quick match games.

            Update gamereporting dependencies on Rooms to use Room RPCs where possible. RPCs for
            setCategoryClientMetaData and getCategoryClientMetaData are used (see GOSOPS-34803), but
            an RPC for getRooms or getCategoryByRoomId is still needed to move gamereporting to aux
            slave (see https://developer.origin.com/support/browse/GOSOPS-35652 ).

            Update osdksponsoredevents to store userid as decimal instead of hexadecimal. Needed in
            order to reference a user from the table (for example, to get the email address from the
            userinfo table). Migrates uid field in osdksponsoredevents_users from varchar(32) to
            bigint(20). This migration will DESTROY all data in osdksponsoredevents_users!
            
            
            RPC calls still use hexadecimal format because this is what editorial JSPs expect; it is
            converted back into the proper format before being stored in the database.

            Madden12 Gen3 - OSDK Changes to fix game reporting in Madden
            - These changes fix two problems. One was found by valgrind where an uninitialized scope
            map pointer causes a crash setting club keyscopes.
            - The second problem is due to us only being able to stress test offline game reports.
            Online Game Reporting stress testing will be available in a future osdk release.

            There is an issue where because of the private player attribute maps, game teams are
            forced to set skipComparision = true for OSDKPlayerReport report. Moved the private
            player attribute maps into a seperate TDF class so skipComparision sets to true for this
            OSDKPrivatePlayerReport TDF only.

            Integrate CL-346619 [GOSOPS-33272][DirtyCast] specifying "any protocol" explicitely when
            creating GS games.
            integrated changelist 345679 from dev8 to 8.x branch (prep work for DirtyCast 8.17.0
            release). Also revert the workaround in gamemanager.cfg for setting
            evaluateGameProtocolVersionString back to true.

            Fixed a server crash issue where when trying to access game settings for offline game
            report, the server will crash because there is no game session associated to offline
            game.

            Fixed a server crashing issue where it is trying to get the sponsored events game
            history for non sponsored event games. Also, fixed cases where mIsValidSponsoredEventId
            can either mean that it is not a sponsored event game or sponsored event games but the
            sponsored event ID is missing from the gamereporting.cfg file.

            Added support for the private attribute maps in the OSDKPlayerReport to paid event game
            reporting. We first search the TDF by tag, then the private attribute map, and finally
            the private integer attribute map for the 'statTag' in the config file. If neither of
            these sources contain the desired stat, we still log an error and enter a value of '0'
            in the game report.

            Fixed memory leak due to failure of inserting surveyAnswers record in to cache. The DB
            table is key-ed by multiple columes/ids, while the cashe is key-ed by a single colume/id
            - surveyId. Now only query the distinct surveyId from DB.
            Also changed caches for surveyAnswers and votingVotes tables to be local vaiables on the
            call stack. These caches store user generated data for 1 user/rpc request. Each request
            should have its own copy of cache.
