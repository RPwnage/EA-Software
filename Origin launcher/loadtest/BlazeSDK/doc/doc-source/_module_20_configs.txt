\defgroup _mod_configs Blaze Server Configurations

Several features of %Blaze require configuration on the %Blaze server. The intention is for title teams to directly manage and maintain their own configurations, including control over deployments of new configurations and configuration reloads or server restarts.

This section provides information about the details for configuring %Blaze servers, both general settings as well as those related to specific features.
