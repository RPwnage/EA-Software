# Layout and PSU:
# Each line in the specified layout file describes a group of stress clients. 
# The syntax is:
#  <name> <count> <config> <count_per_process> <inventoryid_idx>
# where:
# - <name> is the name of the stress client group (e.g. dds, ilt, qm)
# - <count>, multiplied by psuFactor, is the total number of stress instances
# - <config> is the path to the stress client config file (relative to the etc folder)
# - <count_per_process> is the maximum number of stress instances per process
# - <inventoryid_idx> is an index into inventoryids, which indicates the Banyan inventory id  for the stress client containers (this decribes the AWS node(s) that the containers will run on)
#
# See https://console.ea.com/testautomation/settings/${banyanprojectid}/inventory?project=${banyanprojectname} for a list of available inventory ids
