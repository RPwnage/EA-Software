Framework Release Checklist
===========================

1. DO NOT branch release from dev-na-cm.  ALWAYS branch from dev-na.  So make sure all necessary changes are integrated back to dev-na first!
2. Update changelog.md to make sure it has been updated with release version and info.
3. Update Manifest.xml's compatibility XML element's revision attribute with release version number.
4. Update source/Properties/VersionInfo.cs to make sure it has release version number.
5. Check in the changes in dev-na and wait for build farm rebuild Framework and updated the binaries.
6. Then branch Framework in dev-na to //packages/Framework/[release version number]
7. Then update //packages/Framework/[release version number]/Manifest.xml's versionName XML element with release version number.
8. Open the Framework.sln in //packages/Framework/[release version number], remove all projects under "Ext" folder and remove Ext folder.
9. Do a build in "RELEASE" config and check in the new binaries and updated Framework.sln (to make sure it still build and make sure source and binaries match up 100%).
10. Then package and post to package server.
