    // exampleUpstreamBPSRule is an example rule which demonstrates
    // the custom mm rule framework.  This rule compares the upstream
    // bps of a session or game against the desired value on the rule
    // and calculates a match based on the difference between these values.
    // A Gaussian curve is used to determine the fitscore similar to the
    // Game Size Rule in matchmaker.cfg.
    //
    // As this is only an example, this rule is not compiled into the client or server and must
    // be uncommented to be used. See the Dev Guide for Custom Matchmaking for more information.
    //
    // Configuration of this rule mainly determines the Gaussian function parameters and how
    // the rule will handle decay.
    //
    // weight is the weight of this rule as compared to other rules in matchmaking.
    //
    // fiftyPercentFitValueDifference is the difference between two entities skill that yeilds a 
    // 0.5 fit percent.  This value controls the width of the bell curve used to calculate the
    // fit percent between 2 entities.
    // 
    // Below is a table of examples given a fiftyPercentFitValueDifference of 200.
    //
    // Fit Score : Difference
    //       1.0 : +/- 0 (exact match)
    //       .90 : +/- 77
    //       .75 : +/- 128
    //       .50 : +/- 200
    //       .25 : +/- 282
    //       .10 : +/- 364
    //       .00 : INFINITE (match anything)
    //
    //      At heart, we're evaluating: fit percent = e^( - ((x-b)^2 / (c * 1.2011225)^2 )) where
    //          (x - b) is the difference between the two entities
    //          c is the fiftyPercentFitValueDifference which determines the width of the bell curve.
    //
    // NOTE: see commonruleformulas.h GausianFunction.calculate for the implementation.
    //
    // minFitThresholdLists are the lists of thresholds and possible decay for this rule.  
    //      requireExactMatch says that at time 0 and beyond only exact matches will be matched by this rule.
    //      quickMatch says that at time 0 we require an exact match, at time +5 seconds we'll match
    //          anyone with a fit percent of .8, at time +10 seconds we'll match anyone with a fitpercent
    //          of .5 or greater, at time 15 we'll match anyone with a fitpercent of .2 or greater.
