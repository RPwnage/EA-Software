Double click on the batch script to run the client server merge on current p4 workspace. You can check the current workspace using the "p4 client" command. 

The client server merge takes an optional argument if you want to specify the workspace to be used for the client server merge.
The batch file will need to be run from cmd to be able to specify the workspace. 
Eg: ".\client_server_merge.bat ansoni_ml" or ".\client_server_merge.bat ansoni_trama.4"

If no argument is provided, the merge will be done on the current workspace. 

A changelist will be added to the current or specified workspace in P4V if there are any changes to be integrated. 

The bat script uses 3 branch mappings:

client-server-share-blaze-core-(Stream Name)
client-server-share-blaze-custom-(Stream Name)
client-server-share-blaze-proxy-(Stream Name) 

05/18/20: Currently these mappings are defined for ml and Trama.4. In future, these mappings should be created for stability lines when the stream is created.
