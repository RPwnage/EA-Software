  <!-- Manifest Description: This manifest example is split into the following sections:
  - Generic Package Fields
  - Build Specific Fields
  - License Specific Fields 
  - Manifest File Only Packages (packages not hosted on package server, meta data only)
  - Deprecated fields
- NOTE: Package Server manifest files do not meet standards for Valid xml files. Therefore, it is not possible to create a DTD. Ideally, manifest files should be well formed (root elements, closing tags, case sensitive, cdata tags, etc) but the files are not actually required to vaidate.  -->

  <!-- SECTION: Generic Package Fields -->
  <!--  Package Name - Required for manifest file only packages.  Recommended for all packages. Used to create the folder structure in the file share. Used to link the package to the release. (It must be unique.) Can have alpha numeric characters.-->
  <packageName>DevTrack</packageName>
  <!--  Version Name - Required for manifest file only packages.   Recommended for all packages. Used to create the folder structure in the file share. Used to link the package to the release. (It must be unique.) Can have alpha numeric characters. -->
  <versionName>6.203</versionName>
  <!-- Summary (A.K.A About) - HTML enabled. The most recently uploaded summary is used for both the package and release. Older Summaries can be found on the release that it was uploaded with.. -->

    <p>There is some cool stuff in here. You can have now have links like http://frostbite.ea.com/. Links will automatically be turned into HREF tags in the UI.</p>

  <!--  Contact Name - Accepts a string. Both contactName and contactEmail are required if you want to use a distribution list or other mailto.

  <contactName>Browes, Erin</contactName>
  <!--  Contact Email - This can be an email address or a url (http://, file:// or www.) Package Server will first try to match an employee, then it will use the contactName & contactEmail as is (if both are filled in). If it can't do either, the person that uploaded the package will be used as the contact  -->
