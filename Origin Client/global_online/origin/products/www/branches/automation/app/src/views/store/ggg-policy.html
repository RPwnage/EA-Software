Refund requests can be made within twenty-four (24) hours after you first launch the game, within seven (7) days from your date of purchase, or within seven (7) days from the game&rsquo;s release date if you pre-ordered, whichever comes first. And if you purchase a new EA game within the first thirty (30) days of its release date and can&rsquo;t play it due to technical reasons within EA&rsquo;s control, you can request a refund within seventy-two (72) hours after you first launch the game instead of twenty-four (24).
