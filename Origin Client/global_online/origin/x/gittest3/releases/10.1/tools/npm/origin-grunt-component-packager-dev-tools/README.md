> Origin Component Packager Dev Tools



## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

Since this is a private library for use with origin build tools, in this project folder type:
```shell
npm link
```
Wherever you'd like to use this package, type

```shell
npm link origin-grunt-component-packager-dev-tools
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('origin-grunt-component-packager-dev-tools');
```
