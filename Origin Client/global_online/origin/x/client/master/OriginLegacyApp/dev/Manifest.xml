	<description>
		This is the origin app compiled into a static lib. was version 8.5.0.
		If you define a global variable in your masterconfig called "nobuild.OriginLegacyApp" and define it, it won't build OriginLegacyApp as part of your build.
		If you define a global variable in your masterconfig called "incredibuild.OriginLegacyApp" and define it, it will use incredibuild to build the OriginLegacyApp. Otherwise it will use a single processor.
