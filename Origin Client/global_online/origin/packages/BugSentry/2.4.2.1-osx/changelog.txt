== BugSentry 2.4.2 ==
[May 7, 2012]

* Fixed PC64 Initialize.xml issue.




== BugSentry 2.4.1 ==
[May 5, 2012]

* Added Bulk Build support.
* Fixed package to properly build PC64



== BugSentry 2.4.0 ==
[November 8, 2011]

* Added CodeStripper support so this package can easily be stripped and sent to external developers.
* Removed embedded copy of libjpeg and switched to using the eajpeg package now to reduce code space and build times.



== BugSentry 2.3.2 ==
[September 14, 2011]

* Fixed session reporting on X360 with secure connection - the url was being truncated due to string length with the new test server DNS name.



== BugSentry 2.3.1 ==
[August 24, 2011]

* Updated BugSentry to use a DNS name now for the TEST server. GOS OPs changed core XLSP configs to no longer provide remapping on IP addresses.
* Added support in BugSentry to automatically detect if the connection is secure or not, and use the appropriate URL for submitting reports when in TEST mode.



== BugSentry 2.3.0 ==
[May 23, 2011]

* Added support for screenshots on the PC platform (game provides the ImageInfo struct to BugSentry).
* Added support for 64bit PC platforms.
* Corrected crash reports to always use 8 digits for the hex addresses in the callstack.
* Added callstack generation for PS3 crash reports.
* Added support for the game to supply the top stack frame for callstack generation on PS3.
* Fixed some #include issues that caused conflicts when including certain header files such as winsockx.h.
* Provided optional "categoryId" parameter when reporting crashes, allowing the game to override the auto-generated category id if they choose to.



== BugSentry 2.2.1 ==
[June 10, 2010]

* Fixed a rare bug where desync and server report uploads were sometimes not completing.



== BugSentry 2.2.0 ==
[May 21, 2010]

* Server session reporting updated to handle multiple servers. You must now provide the server name, and type (i.e. "blaze", "redirector", etc.), when reporting a server session.
* Server error reporting updated to handle multiple servers. You must now provide the server type (i.e. "blaze", "redirector", etc.) in addition to the server name, when reporting a server error. This allows for metrics tracking on a per sku/server basis.
* Moved the following enumerations to the EA::BugSentry namespace: BugSentryState, BugSentrySession, BugSentryServerErrorType.
* Added GetSessionId() interface to retrieve the static BugSentry session ID that is used for all reporting for that power cycle (unique session id for that boot). This could be used when reporting traditional GOS telemetry to help construct a sequence of events (data from GOS telemetry) before a BugSentry error is reported.
* Session reporting could cause hitching. Optimized the time spent to upload session reports to reduce/eliminate any hitching. This call is still synchronous and doesn't require polling.
* Optimized crash report upload times, uploads are now much faster.



== BugSentry 2.1.0 ==
[May 3, 2010]

* Finalized the design of session reporting. You now must report different types of sessions if you want to give context to your error report numbers. There are currently three types: "boot", "game", and "server", which provide context to the "crash", "desync", and "server" error reports respectively. It is strongly encouraged to add session hooks for boot, going into game, and when *attempting* to connect to your server, so that BugSentry can properly calculate your percentage rates for each error type.
* Added Server error reporting (connection failure & disconnect error types).
* Updated crash reporting to include game-supplied context data (any arbitrary data).
* Added PC support.



== BugSentry 2.0.0 ==
[April 2, 2010]

* Refactored, no longer a singleton - allowing multiple instances to run simultaneously.
* Interfaces simplified
* Added Desync reporting
* Added Session reporting



== BugSentry 1.2.1 ==
[March 29, 2010]

* Xenon: Removing the BUGSENTRYMODE_PRODe override. This was added as a convenience factor and tested well on multiple titles. However, this seems to be contingent on whether the game is connected securely or insecurely to Xbox Live. Because of this, the override has been removed and will now rely solely on the game's config setting for the BugSentry mode.



== BugSentry 1.2.0 ==
[January 22, 2010]

* Added base support for the PC platform.
* Changed the include paths to conform to the standard "BugSentry/<some include file>".
* Updated source to initialize ImagePixel properly, avoiding a warning now visible with PS3 SDK 3.
* Updated initialize.xml to include the fileset "package.BugSentry.libs"
* Xenon: Overriding the mode to always be BUGSENTRYMODE_PROD; the Xbox Live Security Gateway will always remap to TEST in PartnerNET, and PROD in ProductionNET. This eliminates confusion since it really doesn't matter what this is set to on the Xenon platform. This also eliminates possible errors of shipping a game with BugSentry still in TEST mode, which wouldn't be remapped (since TEST mode uses an internal IP address).
* Modifed the GenerateCrashReportFile() interface to allow the game to supply the file path.
* Updated SKU length to allow up to 60 characters (previously was 10 characters).




== BugSentry 1.1.1 ==
[June 23, 2009]

* Added configuration option for the Wii platform to pass in an RSO base address. This address will be subtracted from appropriate callstack addresses to generate relative addresses to match the RSO map file.
* Modified the Wii crash reporter to downsample the screenshot until it fits within the size restriction. If the screenshot data is still too large, it will be excluded from the rest of the report data so BugSentry can at least report the crash.
* Moved the BugSentry configuration mode enumerations from the EA::BugSentry::BugSentryMgr namespace to the EA::BugSentry namespace.
* Added a new version tag to the XML crash report for future report versioning.




== BugSentry 1.1.0 ==
[June 5, 2009]

* Modified Xenon crash reporter to downsample screenshot until it fits within the size restriction. If the screenshot data is still too large, it will be excluded and only a callstack will be reported. Also exposed the image down sample configuration setting to the game so it can set the desired initial down sampling setting.




== BugSentry 1.0.9 ==
[May 22, 2009]

* Modified Xenon interface to allow the game to pass in the front buffer D3DTexture directly. If the game is using RNA, RNA owns the front buffer, so BugSentry is unable to access the front buffer through the D3DDevice. Instead, the game can pass in the front buffer directly using the new interface.




== BugSentry 1.0.8 ==
[May 20, 2009]

* Removed JPEG error strings for non EA_DEBUG builds so the strings won't ship on disc.
* Updated the PROD URL for Xenon to work through the XBL Security Gateway.
