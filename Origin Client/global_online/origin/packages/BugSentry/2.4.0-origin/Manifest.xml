        BugSentry is a retail error reporting system for all EA games. This was developed to not only gain visibility into the stability of our games, but to also fast-track efforts to debug and patch these issues. Additionally, BugSentry can be enabled during development and first party certification to capture debug data for hard to reproduce issues.<br/>
        <br/>
        BugSentry currently supports reporting crashes, desyncs, server connection failures, and server disconnects. BugSentry will include a variety of information in it's report (callstack, screenshot, desync log, game-supplied context data, etc.). This information is reported directly back to EA BugSentry servers when an error occurs (independent of your game's servers), and is immediately available on either the central GOS BugSentry website or your studio's BugSentry website (which provides automatic callstack conversion and other studio-specific processing).<br/>
        <br/>
        BugSentry supports the Microsoft Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, and Sony Playstation 3 consoles, and the PC platform (32 and 64 bit). BugSentry has been approved by Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony; the collection of this data is outlined in the privacy policy and Terms Of Service agreement, and is approved by EA Legal for North American and Euro builds. Please contact EA Legal for full details before incorporting into your title. BugSentry is free for all EA titles to use, please contact GOS if you plan to use BugSentry so the proper resources can be planned for your SKU's user load.<br/>
