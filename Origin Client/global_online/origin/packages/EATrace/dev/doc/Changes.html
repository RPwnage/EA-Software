<h1>EATrace Changes</h1>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.09.05</span> (Unpublished) </p>
<p>Changes<a href="file:///C|/projects/EAOS/UTF/DL/UTFKernel/EATrace/dev/include/EATrace/internal/Config.h">Config</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added formal EA_DEBUG_BREAK support for additional Sony platforms. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.09.04</span> (October 1st, 2012) </p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changed EAOutputDebugStringF to use "EATrace" instead of "EATest".</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.09.03</span> (August 7th, 2012) </p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added winprt build support.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.09.02</span> (July 3rd, 2012) </p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed an Android missing #include for the case of non-bulk-builds.</li>
  <li>Made it so mobile EAOutputDebugString prints to stdout instead of stderr, for consistency with other platforms. </li>
  <li>Added additional platform support.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.09.01</span> (May 7, 2012) </p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changed <span class="small">ZONE_OBJECT_MIN_ALIGN</span> to unilaterally be 16. This has no effect on 64 bit platforms but increases by 8 bytes for 32 bit platforms. While more memory is being used, it's probably small compared to the total being allocated. This change allows ZoneObject to work with heaps other than PPMalloc and allows it to work with 32 bit PPMalloc when <span class="small">PPM_MIN_ALIGN</span> is set to 16. </li>
  <li>Updates for better handling of Microsoft API partitions.</li>
  <li>Adding appropriate wchar_t function overloads for compilers that treat char16_t/char32_t and wchar_t as distinct types.</li>
  <li>Added support for the clang compiler under unix64 configurations.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.09.00</span> (March 6, 2012) </p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added PSVita platform support (<span class="small">EA_PLATFORM_PSP2</span>).</li>
  <li>Added fix for signed/unsigned mismatch warnings on PC with char and wchar_t.</li>
  <li>Made it so the trace macros don't read EA::Trace::TraceHelper::isTracingEnabled directly but use EA::Trace::TraceHelper::GetTracingEnabled() instead. This makes for more predictable behavior in the presence of DLL usage. </li>
  <li>Incorporated usage of __analysis_assume in assertion code, to assist with Microsoft /analysis testing. </li>
  <li>Made EALogConfig enabled by default. Doing so required a few changes to EALogConfig.cpp to allow compiling, but the functionality is unchanged. </li>
  <li>Fixed an EDG compiler warning related to type aliasing in RefCount.h.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.08.02</span> (October 19, 2011) </p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for the Cafe (Wii U) platform.</li>
  <li>Revised the definition of <span class="small">EA_DEBUG_BREAK</span> for Apple platforms to be better. </li>
  <li>Added kLevelPrivate. Refers to a private (local-author-only) debug level, expected to be off by default.</li>
  <li>Added GetAllocator/SetAllocator, which allows EATrace to have a package-specific ICoreAllocator. By default SetAllocator returns the ICoreAllocator default allocator, but the user can override it by calling EA::Trace::SetAllocator.</li>
  <li> Added Get/SetTracingEnabled to TraceHelper, with a corresponding TraceHelper::sTracingEnabled field that is used to gate the <span class="small">EA_TRACE_HELPER_MESSAGE_GL</span> macros. Implemented by Andrew Willmott. </li>
  <li> Added SetAllEnabled(bool enabled) to IServer and TraceHelperTable. This is useful for resetting all user-disabled asserts. Implemented by Andrew Willmott. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.08.01</span> (August 31, 2011) </p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug introduced in v2.08.00 which casued <span class="small">EATRACE_GLOBAL_ENABLED</span> to be defined as 0 by default instead of 1, which it's supposed to be. </li>
  <li>Revised the unit tests to use EATest as a test framework. </li>
  <li>Added <span class="small">EA_PLATFORM_CTR</span> (i.e. Nintendo 3DS), iPhone, and Palm platform support for <span class="small">EA_DEBUG_BREAK</span>.</li>
  <li>Fixed a possible deadlock that results from an AutoMutex in Server::Trace.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.08.00</span> (July 5, 2011) </p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added             virtual void SetFlushOnWrite/GetFlushOnWrite to ILogReporter and ITracer, which allows users to specify on a log-by-log basis whether log writes are flushed immediately after they occur. Also added the <span class="small">EATRACE_FLUSH_ON_WRITE_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT</span> config option to specify the default initial value for SetFlushOnWrite. </li>
  <li>Added TraceHelper::TraceFormattedV(va_list) to complement TraceHelper::TraceFormatted(...)</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.07.03</span> (May 4, 2011) </p>
<p>Release notes </p>
<ul>
  <li>Playbook (Blackberry tablet) platform support has been added and verified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additions </p>
<ul>
  <li>Added codestripper support</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>&lt;none&gt;</li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>Added changes to support platforms that do not define the EA_CHAR16 macro.</li>
  <li>Revised <span class="small">EA_CURRENT_FUNCTION</span> to be more consistent with the EAAssert package.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.07.02</span> (March 14, 2011) </p>
<p>Additions </p>
<ul>
  <li>Added GetDefaultDisplayTraceDialogFunc().</li>
  <li>Added the <span class="small">EATRACE_DEBUG_BREAK_ABORT_ENABLED</span> config parameter, which lets the user specify that abort is used instead of debug-break. </li>
  <li>Added kAlertResultAbort and made <span class="small">EA_ASSERT</span> on Android use it, since debug breaking isn't supported on Android.</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a couple errors related to the definition and usage of <span class="small">EA_TRACE_ENABLED</span>, <span class="small">EA_LOG_ENABLED, </span>and<span class="small"> EA_TRACE_REPORTING_LOCATION</span>. Reported by Jeffrey Sturgeon.</li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>Added some default group names to TraceHelper::TraceHelper. Suggested by Ionut Matasaru.</li>
  <li>Added the <span class="small">EA_TRACE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LEVEL</span> config option, which specifies how detailed <span class="small">__FUNCTION__</span> output is. </li>
  <li>Added the <span class="small">EATRACE_GLOBAL_ENABLED</span> option. If enabled then the Trace system is shared between the application and its DLLs. If disabled then each compilation unit gets its own copy of EATrace.</li>
  <li>Revised the Release function to set the ref count to 0 for debugging purposes. </li>
  <li>Made it so that <span class="small">EA_ASSERT</span> and <span class="small">EA_VERIFY</span> append \n to expression strings. This is useful for the case that assertions are logged to disk. Suggested by Ionut Matasaru.</li>
  <li>Made it so that dialog boxes by default appear on desktop platforms, but not on console platforms. Previously they would appear by default on XBox 360, which probably is not what most users want. </li>
  <li>If dialogs boxes are disabled then assertions cause debug breaks, whereas previously they would do nothing. </li>
  <li>Made it so that <span class="small">EA_TRACE_CA_NEW</span> and <span class="small">EA_TRACE_CA_NEW_ARRAY</span> don't pass on debug parameters (e.g. allocation name) in release builds. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.07.01</span> (November 5, 2010) </p>
<p>Additions </p>
<ul>
  <li>Added ability to call Server::AsInterface(InterfaceId iid) with the Server kIID.</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Fixed an <span class="small">EA_DEBUG_BREAK</span> compile error for ARM+Airplay platform.</li>
  <li>Fixed Shutdown memory allocation problem by making sure that GetTraceHelperTable doesn't do any allocations after the Shutdown method is called.</li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>Changed usage of Vsnprintf8 to Vsnprintf. The former is an older name for the latter and is deprecated. </li>
  <li>Added a print <span class="small">EXIT</span>(n) at the end of the unit tests on wii to support automated running/testing on Wii.</li>
  <li>Added documentation on how to write a custom log/trace output back-end. See EATrace.html.</li>
  <li>Added sample LogReporter code to the unit test.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.07.00</span> (May 31, 2010) </p>
<p>Release notes </p>
<ul>
  <li>This version has been updated to support PS3 SN 330, CodeWarrior 1.3, and Android platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additions </p>
<ul>
  <li>Added IsDebuggerPresent function. Works on all EA platforms, including mobile. </li>
  <li>Added an EA_CRASH macro, which is an alternative to EA_DEBUG_BREAK which explicitly crashes as opposed to attempting to call up the debugger. This is useful for some platforms. </li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a couple cases where the assigned ICoreAllocator wasn't being used. </li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>&lt;none&gt;</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.06.04</span> (February 7, 2010) </p>
<p>Additions </p>
<ul>
  <li>Added unix and unix64 support (which includes OS X and iPhone support). This mostly entailed fixing a couple compiler warnings/errors. </li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug in EATraceBase.h regarding usage of <span class="style2">EA_DEBUG_BREAK_ENABLED</span>. Reported by Bob Flanagan.</li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>Unit tests no longer depend on UTFFoundation package. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.06.03 </span>(October 29, 2009) </p>
<p>Additions </p>
<ul>
	<li>Added LogReporterStdio support to EALogConfig via a new "stdio" reporter type. Submitted by Jon Parise.</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>LogReporterStdio now delegates all output formatting to its Formatter. Submitted by Jon Parise.</li>
  <li>Fixed a compiler warning that results with the latest PS3 GCC. </li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>&lt;none&gt;</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.06.02 </span>(November 24, 2008) </p>
<p>Release Notes</p>
<ul>
  <li>This release removes a dependency on the UTFFoundation package. By doing so it requires that the EAStdC version used with it is v1.03.08 or later. </li>
  <li>The Framework2/nant build of this package doesn't build EALogConfig.cpp any more. The reason for this is that EALogConfig.cpp is still depenent on UTFFoundation, and this package otherwise removes use of UTFFoundation. If you need EALogConfig.cpp in your Framework2-based build, please notify Paul Pedriana and we can get it working sooner rather than later. </li>
</ul>
<p>Additions </p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;none&gt;</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug in log vararg printing for Wii/CodeWarrior. Reported by Bob Flanagan.</li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>CreateDefaultTracer now constructs the created Server with the given pAllocator as opposed to NULL. Suggested by Vincent Lam. </li>
  <li>Removed dependency on the UTFFoundation package. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 2.06.01 </span>(March 20, 2008) </p>
<p>Additions </p>
<ul>
  <li>Added documentation clarifying that you cannot use dynamically calculated EA_LOG group names and how you can work around it. </li>
  <li>Added SNC compiler compatibility.</li>
  <li>Added <font size="-1">EATRACE_VERSION / EATRACE_VERSION_N</font> to the definition set. This allows for determining the version at compile time.</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Fixed potential release build crash for the case that the user makes trace calls without first calling SetTracer. </li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>The assertion macro for SN compiler on PS3 was changed from __builtin_trap to __builtin_snpause. The latter is more friendly to debugging. </li>
  <li>Added printf(&quot;\32&quot;) to end of unit test under PS3 and PS2. This indicates to the SN tools that the app is done.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<ul>
  <li>This package's dependencies have been simplified. See the Changes section. </li>
</ul>
<p>Additions </p>
<ul>
  <li>Added ability for user to control/override debug allocation names. See in <font size="-1">EATRACE_ALLOC_PREFIX</font> in Config.h.</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>&lt;none&gt;</li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>Removed a  dependency on the MemoryMan package and added a dependency on the EAStdC package. Note that this package (EATrace) is still dependent on the UTFFoundation package. The current dependencies of this package (EATrace) are: 		EABase, EASTL, EAStdC, EAIO, EACOM, EAThread, CoreAllocator, UTFFoundation, PPMalloc. </li>
</ul>

<p>Additions </p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;none&gt;</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Added a few #ifndef checks in EATraceBase.h in order to make sure EATrace can co-exist with EAAssert, which has some identical defines. </li>

    <br>
  Release Notes</p>
<ul>
  <li>This version makes EATrace transparently compatible with the EAAssert package. See the notes below in the Changes section. </li>
</ul>
<p>Additions </p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;none&gt;</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>EA::Trace::Configure now longer makes a redundant call to Server::Init().</li>
  <li>Fixed a couple cases of memory being allocated before main which where missed by the v2.04.01 package release. </li>
  <li>Fixed some Linux/Unix header include case sensitivity problems.</li>
  <li>Fixed buffer miscalculation in TracerDialogThread::MessageBoxThreadStart. Submitted by Avery Lee. </li>
  <li>Fixed CodeWarrior/Wii compiler warnings. </li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>Made EATrace explicitly recognize the EAAssert package and be able to use EAAssert's functionality if configured to do so. Recall that EAAsset is a package that is a subset of EATrace which covers most of the assertion functionality present in EATrace. We want the to packages to co-exist cleanly.</li>
  <li>Moved unit tests from UTFFoundation to EATrace.</li>
  <li>Some slight cleanup to EALogConfig ConfigureReporter(). Submitted by Jon Parise. </li>
  <li>Made EATrace explicitly recognize the EAAssert package and be able to use EAAssert's functionality if configured to do so. You don't need to have EAAssert present and EATrace won't see it unless configured so. Recall that EAAsset is a package that is a subset of EATrace which covers most of the assertion functionality present in EATrace.</li>
