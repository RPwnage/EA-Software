Changes/fixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        DirtyJpg
            Changed implementation to work around decoding corruption with the sn-debug-opt target (issue identified
            with ps3sdk 440.001). The 2 uint32_t tables used by _PutColor() to calculate YCbCr were replaced with
            4 uint16_t tables. Thus eliminating the need to use shift operations on unsigned 32-bit values, and
            avoiding the possibility for any compiler (especially SN here) to get confused about the signing when it
            pulls data from Cb_hi/lo and Cr_hi/lo after aliasing them away during code optimization.

        JsonParse
            Fixed JsonGetBoolean, which was not properly parsing data and could return incorrect results.

        ProtoSSL
            Changed to allow use of GOS CA for *.easports.com domain.

        VoipTunnel
            Fixed tracking of the number of concurrent games, if exceeding max number of games print an error message 
            and prevent potential memory stomp.

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        NetConnPS3
            Fixed the NP Account Id not being kept while the NP ticket is still valid.

    DirtySDK (Unix)
        Build
            Added Unix warning suppression for new Wno-unused-but-set-variable warning in gcc version 4.6 and greater.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        ConnApiXenon
            Added a call in ConnApiOnline to the new dirty session manager 'self' control to indicate our local dirtyaddr.
            
        DirtySessionManagerXenon
            Added DirtySessionManagerControl 'self' which sets the local user index based off the passed in xuid.
            
            Changed logic to determine what slot the local user is in when creating a session.  Now the slot is provided 
            by the user, if no slot is provided it picks the first one (for qos).             
                 
        FriendApiXenon
            Fixed a bug where removing the last friend on your list would not update your state properly.

            Fixed a bug where the friends list would not refresh when a new user signed in.

        NetConnXenon
            Fixed NetConnStatus('gtag'). Starting with 13.3.0.3.0-A, the gamertag availability was incorrectly linked
            with user account info state.

        ProtoHttpXenon
             Fixed unreasonable memory consumption issue introduced in DirtySDK 13.3.0.3.0 for instances of ProtoHttp
             that are not using the xhttp-based operation mode. Large http recv buffer and xhttp read buffer are now
             being allocated only if the xhttp-based operation mode is enabled.

        *** Important - Game Client Protocol Change Breaks Backwards Compatibility ***

        In this release the ProtoTunnel packet format was changed in a way that breaks backwards compatibility with
        previous versions of the protocol on all platforms except the Xbox 360.  Any clients or servers utilizing
        game connections that are built with previous versions of DirtySDK will not interoperate with clients or
        servers built with this version moving forward.  PLEASE MAKE SURE TO REBUILD ALL DEDICATED SERVERS THAT
        REQUIRE CLIENTS USING THIS OR A LATER SDK VERSION TO MATCH THE NEW CLIENT VERSION.

New in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        ProtoSSL
            Added ability to set debug level, defaulting to 1.  Setting debug level to 0 eliminates all non-error debug
            output.

        ProtoTunnel
            Added PROTOTUNNEL_MODE_NOCRYPT.

        VoipTunnel
            Added VoipTunnelClientT.uTunnelMode.

    DirtySDK (PC)
        DirtyNetWin
            Added ability to set debug level on a per-socket and global level, defaulting to 1.  Global debug level can
            be set using NetConnControl('spam').

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        VoipHeadsetPs3
            Added two new control selectors required by game teams wanting to default to dvi instead of celp because
            their thread priorities are such that celp hangs VoipStartup():
                VoipControl(NULL, 'dcde', <'celp'|'dvid'>, NULL) --> modify dflt codec before calling VoipStartup()
                VoipControl(NULL, 'drat', <8000|16000>, NULL) --> modify dflt sample rate before calling VoipStartup()

Changes/fixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        ConnApi
            Removed 'phxc' mode.  As ProtoTunnel mode is now per-tunnel setting a global mode is no longer required.

        ProtoHttp
            Changed to reduce debug output at default debug level of 1, and eliminate all non-error debug output at
            debug level 0.  Setting debug level to 2 restores previous level of debug output.

            Fixed an issue when posting chunk-encoded data with a send size smaller than the buffer size.

        ProtoHttpManager
            Fixed HttpManagerControl('apnd') selector to allow specification of a NULL header, as with the
            ProtoHttpControl selector.

            Fixed to apply NULL append header, if no append header is set, when starting a new transaction.  This is
            different from ProtoHttp use where the append header 'sticks' across transactions.  The change is
            necessitated because there is no guaranteed continuity of which http ref will be used spanning multiple
            transactions.

            Changed HttpManagerStatus('href') to allow a NULL pointer as input, in which case the href isn't written
            out but the status returned is valid.

            Changed to reduce debug output at default debug level of 1, and eliminate all non-error debug output at
            debug level 0.  Setting debug level to 2 restores previous level of debug output.  In addition, the
            debugging was reworked to provide better consistency and readability at the default debug level.

        ProtoTunnel
            Removed global prototunnel mode and switched mode to be defined on a per-tunnel basis.  This allows clients
            with different modes to coexist (e.g. a Xenon client and a PS3/PC/Other client) in the same client list.

            Changed protocol header to allow determination of what mode the packet was sent under.  Due to the fixed
            Xenon VDP packet header being sent on the wire little-endian the ProtoTunnel header was changed to follow
            suit.  This breaks backwards compatibility with the protocol on non-Xenon clients.

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        FriendApiPs3
            Fixed a crash when removing friends.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        ConnApiXenon
            Changed to set tunnel mode, hard-coded to XENON.

        DirtySessionManagerXenon
            Changed comments for DirtySessionManagerCreate, the input params are not being used.

            Refactored loop when detecting active user slot.

        QosApiXenon
            Removed SelfAddr from QosApiRefT since it was only accessed in one function.

            Refactored QosApiCreate to use an array of addresses to better identify slot and eliminate potential access
            beyond array when calling DirtySessionManagerCreateSess.

        Xenon       XenonSDK 2.0.21250.7-proxy

Changes/fixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        DirtyCert
            Changed to execute a one-time pre-load when an on-demand request is made, essentially making the pre-load
            operation on-demand.

        NetConn
            Removed explicit CA pre-load on NetConnConnect().  Pre-loading is now executed one time prior to an
            on-demand CA load operation.

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        DirtyErrPS3
            Fixed DirtyErrGetName() to use a bigger internal buffer size (64->96). Required to support this error
            string: SCE_NP_COMMERCE2_SERVER_ERROR_ACCESS_PERMISSION_DENIED/0x80023107

    DirtySDK (WinRT/WinPRT)
        DirtyLibWinRT
            Fixed NetLibDestroy() to properly force the NetLib thread to exit.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        NetConnXenon
            Fixed incomplete language and country tables.

        ProtoHttpXenon
            Disabled auth token acquisition by default.  Auth tokens are not required for https connectivity.

            Added ProtoHttpControl('xtok') selector to enable/disable auth token acquisition.

        Xenon       XenonSDK 2.0.21250.7-proxy

        *** Important - New ProtoSSL Requirement ***

        ProtoSSLConnect() now *requires* a valid DirtyCert service name in the format "game-year-platform", set when
        calling NetConnStartup() by using the -servicename argument, to be set before SSL use is allowed.  Any
        attempt to make a secure connection with ProtoSSL will result in an error if a service name is not set.
        If a service name doesn't include dashes it is assumed to simply be the 'game' identifier, in which case
        DirtySDK will fill in the year and platform.  For games using BlazeSDK, the service name specified should
        match the BlazeSDK service name, therefore the abbreviated usage should not be employed.
        *** PLEASE SET A UNIQUE AND MEANINGFUL SERVICE NAME, EVEN FOR TOOL OR SAMPLE USE ***

        *** Important - New NetGameLinkStream Requirement ***

        ConnApiUpdate() no longer calls NetGameLinkUpdate() internally. Game code using the NetGameLinkStream
        feature now has to explicitly call NetGameLinkUpdate() on a regular basis.

New in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        Build
            Fixed target-get-date-and-version.xml to ignore presence of "API LOCK" string in changelog.txt.

        ConnApi
            Added new ConnApiControl('mvtm’) selector to allow enabling/disabling multiple virtual machines on a single
            pc.

        DirtyCert
            Added DirtyCertStatus() and 'snam' selector, which copies the service name to the output buffer (if not
            null) and returns whether the name is valid or not.

        NetConn
            Added NetConnStartup() "-servicename" parameter, used to set service name required by DirtyCert and
            ProtoSSL.  Secure connections are not be allowed unless a service name is set.

        Platform
            Added 'short' platform names (aligned with Blaze).

        ProtoHttpUtil
            Added ProtoHttpUrlEncodeStrParm2(); this version takes the safe encoding table as a parameter.

        ProtoSSL
            Added embedded VeriSign CA required by Nucleus and other EA services.

        ProtoWebSocket
            Added PROTOWEBSOCKET_CLOSEREASON_* defines to protowebsocket.h so close reasons would be accessible in the
            public api.

            Added PROTOWEBSOCKET_CLOSEREASON_UNKNOWN.

            Added alternate ProtoSSL-compatible function signatures ProtoWebSocketCreate2() and
            ProtoWebSocketConnect2().

            Added saving of close reason.

            Added new ProtoWebSocketStatus() selectors: 'crsn', 'essl', 'host', 'port', 'stat', 'time'.  Unhandled
            selectors are passed through to ProtoSSL.

        ProtoStream
            Added new ProtoStreamControl('xhtp') selector that can be used to enable usage of xhttp internally.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        ProtoHttpXenon
            Added new ProtoHttpControl('ires') selector that can be used to resize inbound receive buffer.

            Added new ProtoHttpControl('rbuf') selector mapping on XHttpSetOption(XHTTP_OPTION_READ_BUFFER_SIZE).

            Added ProtoHttpControl() 'rmax' selector.

            Added support of 64-bit return value to ProtoHttpStatus() 'body' selector.

Changes/fixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        ConnApi
            Fixed ConnApiAddClient from stomping memory if user requests to add a client to a slot outside the valid
            array indexes.

            Fixed ConnApiUpdate() to no longer call NetGameLinkUpdate() internally because it breaks the
            NetGameLinkStream feature: NetGameLinkUpdate() gets called before the game code has time to create a stream
            and inbound stream traffic received from the other end gets dropped because there is not yet a local stream
            to feed it into.

        DirtyCert
            Changed DirtyCertRequestCACert() API to add hostname and port as parameters.

            Changed url formatting; including service name, host name, and port as new parameters for on-demand
            install, using ProtoHttpUrlEncodeStrParm2() with a slightly relaxed safe table to allow periods and dashes
            to be unencoded (results in a much cleaner URL), including DirtyCert version and fixing DirtySDK version
            encoding.

        ProtoHttp
            Fixed _ProtoHttpProcessInfoHeader() (processing 1xx Continue responses) to properly swallow the header.

        ProtoHttpUtil
            Fixed a bug introduced in previous release; ProtoHttpGetHeaderValue() when getting the "location" header
            was inadvertently broken.

        ProtoSSL
            Changed to call DirtyCert with hostname and port when requesting a CA certificate.

            Changed to fail a secure connection if a DirtyCert service name has not been set.

        ProtoWebSocket
            Fixed control packet processing.

    DirtySDK (PC)
        DirtyNetWin
            Changed non-async recv thread receive (disabled by default), when receiving a too-large datagram, to return
            the truncated size of the received data instead of WSAEMSGSIZE (which would get translated to
            SOCKERR_OTHER).  This matches the behavior of the async recv thread implementation as well as the Linux
            version.

            Removed Xenon-specific functionality.

    DirtySDK (WinRT/WinPRT)
        Plat-time
            Fixed compile errors. ds_localtime() changed to always return NULL.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        ConnApiXenonSessionManager
            Fixed _ConnApiXenonSessionManagerDecodeLength() to check for null inputs, the logic correction made in
            Summer 0.2.0 exposed some situations where a null param would result in a crash.

        DirtyNetXenon
            Refactored from dirtynetwin, removed PC-only functionality.

        ProtoTunnel
            Fixed an Xbox 360 issue where voip connection packets that get tunneled weren't being encrypted.

        NetConnXenon
            Fixed to start up and shut down ProtoSSL, as previously implemented in the other netconn platform-specific
            modules.

            Fixed NetConnStatus('gtag') incorrectly returning 0 (success) when the user-provided buffer can't be
            filled with a valid gamertag.

        ProtoHttpXenon
            Enhanced reception throughput by increasing size of strXhttpRecvBuf (receive buffer shared with
            xhttp api) from 1 kBytes to 16 kBytes.

            Changed ProtoHttpCreate() to enforce a minimum size of 16 kBytes for the receive buffer as
            this proved to be necessary to get an acceptable inbound streaming throughput with xhttp.

            Fixed missing mem frees in ProtoHttpDestroy()

            Removed invalid attempt to fetch HTTP headers when handling an XHTTP_CALLBACK_STATUS_REDIRECT event.

        *** Important - Xenon-specific ***
        [action needed] NetConnXenon was improved to properly support the new Nucleus 2.0 sign-in flow.
        The NetConnXenon connection flow can now optionally acquire the Microsoft XSTS token that the BlazeSDK requires
        when it exercises Nucleus 2.0 sign-in flow. To enable that functionality, NetConnStartup() needs to
        be called with the "-xhttp" parameter, and the game's Title ID needs to be configured
        with the right security privileges. Failure to configure the Title ID appropriately will result in
        NetConnXenon never transiting to the "online" connection status. More precisely, the MSFT Network
        Security Authorization List (NSAL) for your title must include the “Nucleus Identity Test Endpoint – PartnerNet” endpoint.
        You can update your NSAL by following these instructions:
            1. Navigate to your title product in the Product Submission Tool (https://tools.xboxlive.com/product/Products/).
            2. Create a new Network Authorization submission.
            3. Select Nucleus Identity Test Endpoint - PartnerNet from the list.
            4. Submit your Network Authorization and wait for the submission to complete.
        If you dont't have access to the product submisssion tool, refer to http://eastandards.ea.com/images/Title_Permissions_Request_Guide.docx
        If you have access, but you fail to view your product, or you fail to select the
        Nucleus Identity Test Endpoint - PartnerNet, then contact MSSubmissions@ea.com

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        Build
            Updated many 1st party libraries to match BlazeSDK.

        NetConn
            Removed 5ms NetConnIdle() rate limiter

        ProtoAdvt
            Fixed a debug print that had one more format specifier than parameter.

        ProtoHttp
            Fixed ProtoHttpGetLocationHeader() to use passed-in buffer instead of private input buffer, and guard against
            possible access to a NULL pState variable.

        ProtoHttpManager
            Fixed HttpManagerStatus('time') to return zero if a handle is not yet active.

        ProtoHttpUtil
            Changed ProtoHttpGetNextHeader() to only skip to the next header before parsing if the characters being
            skipped are a CRLF.  This allows use in situations where the 'next' header is in fact the current header.

        ProtoTunnel
            Added tracking of out-of-order packet discards.

            Added last update tick to ProtoTunnelStatT structure (for send/recv).

            Added per-tunnel tracking of last send/recv timestamp.

            Added restriction to matching unallocated tunnel pass: only packets with an offset of less than 8k are
            considered.  This is an optimization to prevent packets with large offsets from causing server stalls while
            advancing the crypto state a large amount.

            Added restriction to port change detection pass: only tunnels that have not received data for 60 or more
            seconds are considered.  This removes the possibility of pathological rematch conditions when a large
            number of users are from the same address (found in stress testing).

            Increased number of iterations SocketRecvfrom() will be executed from 16 to 64 to allow catching up in cases
            where a stall has occurred.  Generally this is a server-only consideration.

        ProtoWebSocket
            Fixed to handle cases where the user-supplied buffer is to small to receive a websocket header.

            Fixed a build failure with DIRTYCODE_DEBUG define.

        Voip
            Modified VoipCommonStatus('umic') to return uUserMicrValue instead of uUserSendMask.

            Modified VoipCommonStatus('uspk') to return uUserSpkrValue instead of uUserRecvMask.

            Modified VoipCommonStartup() to initialize both uUserMicrValue and uUserSpkrValue to 0xFFFFFFFF.

            Removed code setting connection bit in uUserSendMask/uUserRecvMask (in VoipConnectionStart()) because
            it is no longer needed: both uUserMicrValue and uUserSpkrValue are now defaulting to 0xFFFFFFFF.

        VoipTunnel
            Added tracking of out-of-order packet discards

            Added new function VoipTunnelClientListMatchSockaddr() providing a faster and more efficient lookup than
            using VoipTunnelClientListMatchFunc() with a Sockaddr() matching function.


    DirtySDK (BlackBerry10)
        Build
            Added BlackBerry 10 support

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        NetConnPS3
            Fixed compiler warning: comparison between signed and unsigned", by casting.

    DirtySDK (Unix)
        Build
            Fixed unix-gcc-* builds for unix64

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        Build
            Fixed build break with XHTTP enabled.

            Renamed global property dirtysdk-xhttp dirtysdk-noxhttp. Solution now compiles with XHTTP/XAUTH enabled by
            default.

        ConnApiXenon
            Fixed for NULL terminator '\0' instead of '/0'

        ConnApiXenonSessionManager
            Fixed _ConnApiXenonSessionManagerDecodeLength() to properly dereference pLength1 and pLength2.

        DirtyAuthXenon
            Added iUserIndex parameter to DirtyAuthGetToken.

            Added code to surface the XSTS token to netconnxenon ->  DirtyAuthCheckToken() now has 2 new out parameters:
            pTokenLen and pToken.

            Fixed wrong token pointer being freed in DirtyAuthDestroy().

            Modified DirtyAuthDestroy() such that it now transfers the responsibility of freeing token entries to NetConn
            (using NetConnControl('recu')) when token acquisition is still in progress.

        DirtySessionManagerXenon
            Removed code introduced to delay the call to XSessionDelete(). At the moment, we can't explain why this code
            was initially introduced. And it proves to cause some player disconnections in the case where the delete is
            queued for several seconds (up to ~10s) before being invoked: that blocks the next connections from
            succeeding.

        HlBudApiXenon
            Fixed bug when iFriendIndex equals iFriendsCount.

        NetConnXenon
            Added support for the 'tick' status selector which is required to surface the XSTS token to BlazeSDK.
            And also created the 'aurn' control selector as a mean for the game team to specify the URN to be used when
            acquiring the token.

            Fixed NetConnControl('aurn') return code.

            Added NetConnControl('tick') for Blaze.

            Modified NetConnXenon connection flow such that call to XAuthStartup() is only performed when we are
            guaranteed that at least one user is signed-in with XBL. This is a requirement for XAuthStartup() to succeed.

        ProtoHttpXenon
            Changed DirtyAuthGetToken() to now need to be fed with a user index. Tailored code accordingly.

            Made fixes to get 13.x xhttp support functional (previously it was only working in the 8.18.x release line).

            Cleaned up (removed unnecessary redefinition of protohttputil definitions)

        Xenon       XenonSDK 2.0.21076.11-1-proxy

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        Build
            Removed DETAILS_AT_TOP from doxygen config files because that tag has become obsolete with latest version of
            doxygen.

            Removed deadcode specific to "rev" platform which is no longer supported.

            Deprecated usage of target build-res to get rid of this warning at build time: "[echo] WARNING: target
            'build-res' is deprecated. 'build' target uses BuildStep objects to perform resource compilation and
            vstomaketools supports building PC resources."

            Fixed errors in dxy files.

            Fixed unix-gcc-* builds.

        DirtyCert
            Fixed a bug with DirtyCert refcounting of an on-demand install (introduced in DirtySDK 8.18.3) that would
            cause a refcounted request to incorrectly fail, for example if a two HTTPS requests were made to the same
            host, requiring an on-demand CA install, in quick succession.

        CryptArc4
            Added string encrypt functions (similar to CryptSSC2, which is deprecated).

        CrypthMac
            Added crypthmac.

        Platform
            Added definition of char8_t.

        Plat-time
            Added new function ds_strtotime2(), which takes an explicit time format.  Also added parsing of ISO_8601
            format.

        ProtoHttp
            Changed that if the maximum redirection limit is set to set to zero (ProtoHttpControl('rmax'),
            auto-redirection is now considered disabled.  A ProtoHttp ref configured this wey, on receiving a redirection
            response, will end in normal termination with the header available for parsing.  If 'rmax' is greater than
            zero and the redirection count is exceeded, the request will fail.  Previously, an 'rmax' of zero would have
            resulted in immediate failure on any redirection.

            Changed  when parsing "location" header, rather than checking for the absense of http:// or https:// to
            indicate a relative URL, "://" is checked. This provides more generic behavior for cases where the protocol
            of the URL in the location header is not "http" or "https".

            Restored ProtoHttpUrlEncodeIntParm to older implementation, which fixes failure to append param (resulting
            in qos crash).

        ProtoHttpUtil
            Refactored protohttp utility functions into separate module, protohttputil.

        ProtoSSL
            Added debug-only changes: added new alert defines, added output of alert names, added a print explicitly
            indicating when a close warning has been issued.

        ProtoWebSocket
            Added support for websockets.

        QosApi
            Introduced a platform-independent fix made to QosApi in the dev8 branch (but specifically added for cafe).

            Modify to handle rare cases where timed out probes arrive when we had all ready reissued probes to replace
            them; in this scenario there was a small possibility of a crash.

        VoIP
            Deprecated VoipShutdown() and renamed VoipShutdown2() to VoipShutdown().

    DirtySDK (iOS)
        Build
            Added "Security" to the "iphone-extra-frameworks" global property. Required by cryptrand.c.

        Platform
            Altered ds_localtime function so that iOS and Linux fall into default preprocessor case.

        CryptRand
            Fixed missing includes causing build break on iOS.

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        Dirtysock
            Modified implementation to enter –act connection status on PS3 when we receive the ps3 error
            CELL_NET_CTL_ERROR_NP_NO_ACCOUNT.

        NetConnPS3
            Release mutex if cannot request ticket.

    DirtySDK (PSP2)
        Plat-time
            Fixed ds_localtime().

    DitySDK (Xenon)
        DirtySessionManager
            Fixed a debug printf.

            Re-introduced a critical fix that was removed from DirtySDK starting with version 8.17.0.  The fix is
            required to avoid a system RIP upon user signout or upstream disconnection: calls to XSession functions are
            skipped if session host got signed out from XBL.

            Fixed wrong XUID comparison in _DirtySessionManagerIsSessionCleanable().

            Fixed an issue where after a host migration the 'sflg' selector would return incorrect flags, because the
            host flag was not updated properly.  This resulted in attempts to modify those flags failing since the system
            would interpret the modification as an attempt to change host.

        HlBuddyApiXenon
            Modified to update list of friends after friends update.

            Modified to fix issue where number of friends in roster didn't increase.

        NetConnXenon
            Modified to return reference to friends modules before calling _NetConnUpdate.

            Moved the support for the 'plug' selector up in the implementation of NetConnStatus(), i.e. before the
            attempt to call _NetConnUpdate(). This is to avoid infinite recursion when 'plug' is invoked from the
            DirtySessionManager's update function.

            First version of cryptographic prng.  Utilizes platform-provided prng where available, otherwise uses the
            prng from ProtoSSL.

        JsonFormat
            New JSON formatter for internal use.

        JsonParse
            New JSON parser for internal use.

        plat-time.c
            Made iOs and Linx default cases.

        Platform

            Added new function ds_strtotime2(), which takes an explicit time format.  Also added parsing of ISO_8601
            format.

        ProtoHttp
            If the maximum redirection limit is set to set to zero (ProtoHttpControl('rmax'), auto-redirection is now
            considered disabled.  A ProtoHttp ref configured this wey, on receiving a redirection response, will end in
            normal termination with the header available for parsing.  If 'rmax' is greater than zero and the redirection
            count is exceeded, the request will fail.  Previously, an 'rmax' of zero would have resulted in immediate
            failure on any redirection. When parsing "location" header, rather than checking for the absense of http://
            or https:// to indicate a relative URL, "://" is checked.  This provides more generic behavior for cases
            where the protocol of the URL in the location header is not "http" or "https".

            Refactored protohttp utility functions into separate module, protohttputil.

            Refactor/cleanup to allow PUT/POST transactions to follow the normal download flow once the data has been
            uploaded.

        ProtoSSL
            Added CryptRandInit()/Shutdown().

            Added a guard in ProtoSSLSend() to prevent the possibility of sending zero bytes.  Sending zero bytes over an
            encrypted connection when using stream ciphers (e.g. RC4) is not permitted and can result in the connection
            being closed by the remote endpoint.

        ProtoWebSocket.c
            Uses CryptRand for rng.

            Added append header functionality.

            Set verbosity levels for debug prints.

            Removed explicit 'Origin' header functionality (use append header instead).

    DitySDK (WinRT/WinPRT)
        First public release of DirtySDK supporting WinRT and WinPRT.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        Hlbudapi
            Modified to update list of friends after friends update

        NetConn
            Modified to return reference to friends modules before calling _NetConnUpdate.

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        Build scripts
            This is the first 13.1.x version requiring FW3 for building.

            Switched from using excludes in the masterconfig to using includes, and explicitly listing each configuration.

            Cleaned up masterconfig.xml: removed all packages that used to be required to build for "rev", since "rev"
            support was deprecated a long time ago.

        CryptSSC2
            Was removed in release 13.1.0.1.0. Re-introduced in this release specifically for OSDK needs, but is still
            deprecated.

        DirtyNet
            Added async recv thread support for TCP sockets, as well as ability to enable/disable async recv thread
            functionality on a per-socket basis. TCP sockets default to disabled, DGRAM/RAW sockets to enabled, so the
            default behavior is the same as in previous versions.

        ProtoSSL
            Rewrote Subject Alternative Name (SAN) object parsing and subsequent comparison against host name to remove a
            previous restriction, where the SAN field was limited to a fixed size (a 512 byte buffer, with a one-byte
            overhead per SAN string and one NUL byte).

    DirtySDK (PC)
        General
            Added pragmas around inclusion of Microsoft header files to disable compiler warnings and avoid warnings in
            header files we have no control on.

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        DirtyNetPS3
            Added a call to sys_net_free_thread_context() right after gethostbyname() returns in _SocketLookupThread().
            sys_net_free_thread_context() explicitly frees thread information created implicitly within libnet. We use
            it to avoid these resources remaining allocated while we sleep waiting for the thread to be told to exit.
            This proved to help avoiding gethostbyname() returning NETDB_INTERNAL while several name resolutions are
            in progress concurrently.

        Xenon       XenonSDK 2.0.20871.2-proxy

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        Build
            Updated scripts to resolve issues encountered with framework 3 multi-threaded builds.

        FriendApi
            Move FriendApiEventsE into FriendEventDataT reducing arguments passed inot FriendApiNotifyCbT.

        NetGameDistServ
            Added tracking of no-input mode, last flow control input from client, and added new NetGameDistServStatus()
            function to expose these values with 'ninp' and 'fctl' selectors, respectively.

        Platform
            Added ds_stricmpwc() and ds_strcmpwc() for wild-card string comparisons (supporting '*' only).

        ProtoHttpManager
            Fixed a bug introduced 13.1.0.1.0, which broke ability to specify custom headers using HttpManagerCallback().

            Added 'hndl' and 'href' HttpManagerStatus() selectors to convert between ProtoHttp ref and HttpManager handle.

        ProtoSSL
            Restrict GOS CA use to *.ea.com domains.

            Refactored, streamlined ASN.1 parser.

            Added data range checking to protect against bad data possibly causing access violations.

            Fixed certificate bypass, which must come after the certificate is parsed for secure communications to be
            possible.

            TLS1.1 support

        VoipCommon
            Remove some prints that indicated an error during normal operation (users not signed into every slot).

        VoipConnection
            Minor refactoring, removal of un-needed code.

        VoipTunnel
            Added two variables to the VoipTunnelClientT (uLastGameRecv and iUserData0) for user applications use.

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        DirtyAddrPS3
            Fixed implementation of DirtyAddrGetLocalAddr() to fill in the local address instead of the external address.

        DirtyLibPS3
            Modified to not ignore errors when return value is different than CELL_OK; when calling sys_ppu_thread_create,
            sys_mutex_trylock, sys_mutex_lock and sys_mutex_unlock.

        VoipHeadsetPS3
            Fixed crash when unknown codec is used.

    DirtySDK (Unix)
        DirtyNetUnix
            Fixed a rare shutdown condition encountered in the DirtyCast GameServer where a _SocketLookupThread() invoked
            immediately prior to the GameServer being shut down, and then executing after NetConnShutdown() but before the
            termination of the process, would cause a segment violation to occur.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        ConnApiXenon
            Minor refactoring, removal of un-needed code.

            Change client connflags to have the game bit set on the topology host. Makes it easier to deal with cases
            that needs it set, like 360 demangle.

        DirtyNetWin
            Added Null guard when accessing pDirtyLSP

        FriendApi
            Modified to signal you, about all known friends before initialization complete event, like ps3 already did.

        DirtySessionManagerXenon
            Improved some debug traces.

Removed in this release:

    DirtySDK (Xbox 360)
        XnFriends
            The xnfriends module has been removed; friendapi replaces the functionality previously
            provided by this module.

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        Build
            Android is no longer excluded from builds.

        DirtyVers
            Created a new DIRTYSDK_VERSION_MAKE() macro that can be used to create a version integer from
            the version's year, season, major, minor and patch attributes.

        FriendApi
            Added mechanism to signal FRIENDAPI_EVENT_INIT_COMPLETE event.

            Removed call to FriendApiControl start and stop.

            Implemented FriendApiIsUserFriend function.

            Added user index field to FriendEventDataFriendUpdatedT and FriendEventDataFriendRemovedT structures.

            Modified to not update friend until network is connected.

            Deprecated FRIENDAPI_EVENT_MSG_ATTACH_RCVED and FRIENDAPI_EVENT_MSG_ATTACH_RESULT.

            FriendEventDataT now contains a union of event-specific data.

            FriendApiNotifyCbT no longer has a pFriendData. This info is now part of the FriendEventDataT.

            Introduced FriendApiIsUserFriend signature.

            Added FriendApiIsUserFriend function.

        DirtyNet
            Modified SocketCreate() to now take 3 parameters (iThreadPrio, iThreadStackSize, iThreadCpuAffinity), all
            used when creating NetLib and the SocketRecvThread.

        Netconn
            Added new global ProtoSSL startup/shutdown.

        NetLib
            Modified NetLibCreate() to now take 3 parameters (iThreadPrio, iThreadStackSize, iThreadCpuAffinity), all
            used when creating the _NetLibThread.

            Replaced NetLibDestroy() with NetLibDestroy2().

        Platform
            Added ds_strtoll().

        ProtoHttp
            Added 64-bit transfer support.

            Fixed a minor issue in _ProtoHttpRecvFirstHeaderLine (missing break). This caused a header of under 64
            bytes to not be processed, and result in a timeout.

        ProtoHttpManager
            Added 64-bit transfer support.

            Added 'apnd' support.  There are two levels of append functionality; global and ref-specific.  If 'apnd' is
            called with -1 for the handle, a global append header will be set that will be applied to all transactions.
            If 'apnd' is called with a specific handle the append header will apply just to that handle.  If a global
            append header is set, and then a ref-specific append header is set, the ref-specific append header will take
            precedence for that ref, and the global append header will not be applied.

            Fixed to ignore -1 results when checking for lost pipe commands.  This is important because XHttp doesn't
            support this selector, and so httpmanager was erroneously thinking piped commands were always lost.  This
            change is cross-platform but the fix is Xenon-specific, when using XHttp instead of ProtoHttp.

        ProtoSSL
            Fixed to allow certificate bypass to work in all situations; introduction of multi-certificate support broke
            this in DirtySDK 8.15.0.

            Implemented a unified session cache; this allows SSL resume to work across all ProtoSSL instances.

            Added ProtoSSLStartup() and ProtoSSLShutdown() APIs, used internally to manage global SSL state such as the
            unified session cache.

        Utilities
            Removed lobbytagfield.h, a stub that included tagfield.h that was providing compatibility with older
            TelemetrySDK versions.

        Voip
            Refactored some internal logics to fix incorrect handling of user's mute flags upon voip connection
            establishment.

            Removed VoipRecomputeMasks(), VOIP_CBTYPE_CHANEVENT, and VOIP_CBTYPE_USEREVENT.

            Renamed VoipCommonRecomputeMasks() to VoipCommonReapplyChannels().

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        DirtyErrPS3
            Added new sysmodule error codes.

        DirtyNetPS3
            Use volatile specifier to force re-load of recvstat variable, to address possible threading issue between
            SocketRecvfrom() and SocketControl('push').

        HlbudApiPS3
            Tailored for public api changes in FriendApi.

        NetConnPS3
            Created 'lprx' and 'uprx' control selector for module loading/unloading.

            Added MLU PS3 Login Flow.

            Fixed NetConnControl 'tick' selector index when used for sub users.

        VoipCelpPS3
            Removed printfs from celp callbacks.

        VoipHeadsetPS3
            Changed default codec from dvi to celp, and default sampling rate from 8kHZ to 16kHz.

    DirtySDK (PSP2)
        DirtyNetPSP2
            Use volatile specifier to force re-load of recvstat variable, to address possible threading issue between
            SocketRecvfrom() and SocketControl('push').

        HlbudApiPSP2
            Tailored for public api changes in FriendApi.

    DirtySDK (Unix)
        DirtyNetUnix
            Enabled SocketHost() implementation for Android (for successful IP address retrieval on Android).

            Fixed NetCritTry(), which was not checking for the return code correctly.

            Use volatile specifier to force re-load of recvstat variable, to address possible threading issue between
            SocketRecvfrom() and SocketControl('push')

    DirtySDK (Win)
        DirtyNetWin
            Fixed crash on Xbox 360 if DirtyLSPStart() fails, likely due to XTitleServerCreateEnumerator() or
            XEnumerate() failure.

            Fixed an issue on Xbox 360; in _RemoveLSPMapping(), called when an XLSP connection is forced closed due to
            the idle timer expiring.  The bug manifests when more than one name mapping entry references the same XLSP
            service name.  If both names had been referenced and mapped previously, when expired only one of the names
            would be restored, leaving the other name(s) pointing to a now invalid address map entry.  This would result
            in a timeout condition when trying to resolve that name, instead of the expected behavior of re-connecting
            to the XLSP.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        FriendApi
            Made module MLU compatible.

            Implemented functionality provided by xnfriends.c.

        ProtoHttpXenon
            Fixed to close handles in reverse order of allocation.  The incorrect order was shown to cause an XDK
            assertion in certain cable-pulling scenarios.

            Fixed issue where a download completion notification can include data; this final bit of data was being
            erroneously dropped.

        NetConnXenon
            Made NetConnConnect disallow guest login on xbox hud by default, enable it with "-guest=true".

            Corrected recursion.

            Removed friends functionality.

            Created new optional -threadstacksize parameter mapping on the new iThreadStackSize parameter of
            SocketCreate().

        VoipXenon
            Replaced call to netconnxenon functions with friendapi functions.

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (all)

        General
            DirtySDK public header files are now namespaced. Public header files used to be located in the
            <DirtySDK root>/core/include directory. They are now located in <DirtySDK root>/include/DirtySDK/<module>.

            Modified source code to use DirtySDK replacement string functions (ds_vsnprintf(), ds_vsnzprintf(),
            ds_snzprintf(), etc.).

        DirtyLang
            Formerly LobbyLang.

            Added support for currency codes.

        DirtyNet
            Deprecated SocketError().

        DirtyVers
            DirtySDK now complies with the new EADP version nomenclature (http://confluence.ea.com/display/EADP/EADP+Version+Nomenclature).
            The version number is now represented numerically as a 10 decimals digits, each subsequent 2 digits
            represents the next version part. For example, 12301020301 would mean, year '13, season 1, release 2,
            minor 3 and patch number 1.

        FriendApi
            FRIENDAPI_EVENT_BLOCKEDLIST_UPDATED event was renamed to FRIENDAPI_EVENT_BLOCKLIST_UPDATED event.

            New supported event: FRIENDAPI_EVENT_BLOCK_USER_RESULT.

            FriendEventDataT now has a bSuccess field valid with the new FRIENDAPI_EVENT_BLOCK_USER_RESULT event.

        LockerApi
            Deprecated

        NetConn
            Created NetConnMachineId(), which can be used to obtain a unique id for the console.

            Added uSlot parameter to NetConnConnectSub().

        NetGameDist
            Deprecated NetGameDistStream.

            Deprecated 'meta', 'metm' and 'metv' selector in NetGameDistControl(). Equivalent functionality is
            now availabe in NetGameDistMetaSetup().

        NetGameDistServ
            Removed stream support in NetGameDistServCreate() and NetGameDistServHighWaterChanged() because
            NetGameDistStream is now deprecated.

        NetGameDistStream
            Deprecated

        NetGameLink
            Deprecated packet type GAME_PACKET_DEAD.

        ProtoFilter
            Deprecated

        ProtoHttp
            Modified code building the user-agent string to now use the new EADP version format.

            Made kind parsing slightly more robust in the event of a strKind buffer that is too small (and simpler
            in general).

            Fixed a bug with streaming post where the return result was -1 indicating an error condition incorrectly.

        ProtoUpnp
            Adapted module to api changes in XmlParse (See XMLParse notes).

        ProtoTestApi
            Deprecated

        QosApi
            Added "tags" to the public struct/enum to prevent PC64 compile warnings when corresponding
            typedef are forward declared externally.

            Adapted module to api changes in XmlParse (See XMLParse notes).

        Utilities
            The "Lobby" prefix was removed in the name of the following DirtySDK utilities:
                LobbyBase64.h       -->     Base64.h
                LobbyDispList.h     -->     DispList.h
                LobbyLang.h         -->     DirtyLang.h
                LobbyHasher.h       -->     Hasher.h
                LobbySort.h         -->     Sort.h
                LobbyTagField.h     -->     TagField.h
                LobbyUtf8.h         -->     Utf8.h
            Function names in the respective APIs were also changed accordingly.

        TelemetryApi
            Deprecated. Telemetry client implementation was moved to the new TelemetrySdk package.

        Ticker
            Deprecated.

        Voip
            Added a new iData parameter to VoipStartup(). Only used for xenon at the moment.
            (See VoipXenon notes)

            Moved implementation of the voip channel feature from VoipGroup module to Voip module.
                VoipGroupSelectChannel()   -->   VoipSelectChannel()
                VoipGroupResetChannels()   -->   VoipResetChannels()

            Added MLU (Multi Local Users) support to the voip channel feature: VoipSelectChannel()
            and VoipResetChannels() both have a new iUserIndex parameter now. Multiple local users
            can now subscribe to different voip channels.

            Added new VOIP_CBTYPE_USEREVENT to VoipCbTypeE enum in voipdef.h, used to notify a voip user
            registration change.

        VoipCommon
            Added a new iData parameter to VoipCommonStartup(). Allows the user to override the
            default XAudio2 processor value used when calling XAudio2Create().

        VoipConnection
            Modified to deal with multiple local users subscribing to different voip channels:
            a single voip packet now only conveys sub-pkts from the same local user.

        VoipGroup
            Moved implementation of voip channel feature from VoipGroup module to Voip module.
            (See Voip module notes)

        VoipHeadset
            Added a new iData parameter to VoipHeadsetCreate(). Allows the user to override the
            default XAudio2 processor value used when calling XAudio2Create().

        VoipPacket
            Voip packets modified for MLU support:
                * VoipMicrInfoT no longer has a aDataMap field to indicate which user a sub-pkt
                  belongs to.
                * New uUserIndex field added to VoipMicrInfoT. Now all sub-pkts in a given
                  VoIP packet belongs to the same local user.
                * A new VoipPacketChanT type was created for storing the VoIP channel config.

        XmlList
            Deprecated.

        XmlParse
            Changed XmlParse functions to take char * parameters instead of unsigned char * parameters,
            removing the need for ugly typecasting by the caller.

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        FriendApiPrivPS3
            Deprecated 'cbfp' and 'cbup' control selectors. For visibility on NP Basic events, game code now
            needs to registers a callback with FriendApiAddCallback().

            Fixed FriendApiBlockUser(). Completion of the blocking operation is now notified with an
            asynchronous notification: new FRIENDAPI_EVENT_BLOCK_USER_RESULT event.

            Fixed the NP Basic handler to not queue a call to sceNpBasicGetEvent() when
            iRetCode is not success.

            Replaced strcmp() with sceNpUtilCmpNpId() for NpId comparisons.

        HLBudApiPS3
            Adapted to the deprecation of 'cbfp' and 'cbup' control selectors at the FriendApi level.

        NetConnPS3
            Improved sub-user signin.

    DirtySDK (PSP2)
        NetConnPSP2
            Added 'noticket' option to NetConnConnect() to allow connecting without requesting an NP ticket.
            NetConnPSP2 was made similar to NetConnPS3 for consistency.

            Fixed implementation to no longer replace the internally cached ServiceId value each time a
            ticket is requested. A similar fix was made to NetConnPS3 lately. NetConnPSP2 was made similar to
            NetConnPS3 for consistency.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        ConnApiXenon
            ConnApiCbRankT, used upon CONNAPI_CBTYPE_RANKEVENT, has member uValid renamed to uReportValid, for clarity.
            This field indicates whether the report has been filled by the game team. If set to false, rank report
            is discarded. If set to true, rank reports will be submitted.
            Furthermore, a new field, uPartialTableValid, has been added. By default, this field is set to false. This
            means "submit rank for everybody". If the field is set to true, the game team must fill uScoreValid[]. This
            allows the game team to specify for which of the clients the rank report is submitted. (partial rank report)

        ConnApiXenonSessionManager
            Safer handling of combined session strings: protection against buffer over-runs.

        DirtySessionManagerXenon
            Made MLU (Multi Local Users) ready.

        FriendApiPrivXenon
            Fixed FriendApiBlockUser(). Completion of the blocking operation is now notified with an asynchronous
            notification: new FRIENDAPI_EVENT_BLOCK_USER_RESULT event.

        NetConnXenon
            Refactored connection flow. Improved implementation of -silent parameter and ST_EXT_CLEANUP state support.

            Modified connection flow for MLU: connection flow is no longer gated if some users but not all are logged in.

            Changed the 'mask' selector so that only logged in users are considered. Results in all user-based operations
            using only logged in users. Voip registration for example.

            The iData parameter of NetConnConnect() is no longer used to pass a mask of game-selected local users.
            All local users signed-in with XBL are considered as "active" by NetConnXenon.

            Added guard to prevent against NetConnUpdate recursion during external cleanup. Addresses a possible
            stack overflow while shutting down DS.

        VoipXenon
            Added a new iData parameter to VoipStartup(). Allows the user to override the default
            XAudio2 processor value used when calling XAudio2Create().

            Created new '+pbk' and '-pbk' control selectors to enable/disable playback of voice from a
            specified remote user for a specific local user.
