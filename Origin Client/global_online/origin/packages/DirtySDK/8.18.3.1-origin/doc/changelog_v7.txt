Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        DirtyNet
            Added 'bndu' selector as a variant of the 'bind' selector. The latter one is
            walking the list of all sockets, the new one is only walking the list of sockets
            of type SOCK_DGRAM.

        DirtyPng
            Fixed an issue with the png decoder where unrecognized chunks where returning a
            critical error when they were actually ancillary.

        ProtoHttp
            Fixed redirection to properly auto-redirect 3xx responses as based on Firefox
            behavior.  300 "multiple choices", 304 "not modified", and 307 "temp redirect"
            redirection (the latter strictly when in response to a POST request) are no longer
            auto-redirected and must be handled by the application.  Otherwise, POST requests
            that result in redirection result in a subsequent GET request (fixing the previous
            behavior where another POST request would be issued).

        ProtoTunnel
            ProtoTunnel now uses the 'bndu' control selector instead of 'bind' when querying
            the SocketInfo function.

        Voip
            Added the ability to clear the voip event callback.  Passing in NULL for the callback
            will set the callback to the default internal callback and set the userdata to NULL.

        TelemetryApi
            Added 'flsh' control selector which attempts to send telemetry data regardless
            of whether the buffer is nearly full or not.

        VoipGroup
            Fixed clean up code to remove voip callback upon VoipGroupManager destruction.

        VoipTunnel
            Added VoipTunnelGameT structure.

            Added VoipTunnelClientListAdd2 (VoipTunnelClientListAdd is deprecated).

    DirtySDK (PC)
        DirtyNetWin
            Changed SocketLookup functionality to use new DirtyLSP interface.

        VoipHeadsetPC
            The notion of headset status now has a meaning on PC. Headset status is OK when
            both an active input device and an active output device are detected.

        VoipPC
            Added support for the new headset status values.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        DirtyLspXenon
            Renamed dirtylsp.h to dirtylspxenon.h and made it public.
            
            Changed DirtyLSP interface to no longer take a HostentT but instead take a
            DirtyLSPQueryRecT so as to make the interface more generic.  As the interface
            was not previously exposed this change is not considered an API change.

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
    
        DirtyNet
            Added SocketControl() '*xam' selector.  This selector updates all pre-existing name mappings in the name map table that match the specified sitename key with the given secure address.

            Updated _MapAddress() to work with a name map that does not invoke a subsequent address map operation.

            Debug-only update to _DisplayNameMapEntry() to display both strRemap and uRemap, instead of just one or the other.

        CryptRSA
            Increased CryptRSAT.KeyModData and CryptRSAT.KeyExpData from 256+1 bytes to 512+1 bytes to allow signature validation of 4096-bit signatures.

        ProtoSSL
            Increased X509CertificateT.KeyModData and X509CertificateT.KeyExpData from 256 to 512 bytes to support certificates with 4096-bit signatures.

            Added a check to certificate matching (previously only comparing CA Issuer to Cert Subject) to also reject CAs whose modulus does not match the Cert signature size.

            Refactored certificate matching to try all matching certs instead of simplay failing if the first match is not the correct certificate.  This allows for multiple CAs where the Issuer and modulus size are identical, but the signatures are not.

        NetGameDist
            corrected debug traces in netgamedist
            
    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        DirtySessionManagerXenon
            Improved information conveyed in debug traces for async pending callback mechanism
            
            Fixed code such that no wait period applies after first expiry of wait period for XSessionDelete().
            
            XSessions will now be deleted on cable pulls.
            
        Voip
            Fixed multithreading issues when closing voip connections (GOSOPS-4110).

    DirtySDK (Wii)
        DirtyNet
            Internal buffer used by Socket Interface module was allocated under wrong memory module id.

        Build
            Moving -relax_pointers from the Wii config overrides to these build types.

    DirtySDK (Unix)
        NetConn
            Improved debug traces.

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        CommUdp
            Bits 24-27 are no longer used in the sequence number but are reserved for meta-data.  This
            breaks commudp backward compatibility so both ends of any commudp channel must be using
            a version prior to 7.6.0 or both be using version 7.6.0 or later.

        ProtoHttp
            Added Pipelining support when used with ProtoHttpManager.
            
            Added another new callback type, this time returning an int32_t for each of the receive and
            send header callbacks.  Previous types are still supported but will be deprecated in V8.
            
            Added ability to support an error return value from the custom header callback.
            
            Fixed retry of failed keep-alive send request.

        ProtoHttpManager
            Added Pipelining.
            
            Added option to pipe without prior keep-alive (defaulted to enabled).
            
            Added option to restrict max number of requests that will be piped (defaulted to four).
            
            Improved keep-alive, queueing, and error conditions/deferred execution.
            
            Restricted 'cbup' control calls to be valid only when in the IDLE state.

        ProtoUpnp
            Fixed possible memory stomp if number of router-specified services exceeded the maximum
            defined (4).  Also increased the max service count to 5.
            
            Refactored reset of module state into its own function, and added reset of service count.

        QosApi
            Latency and firewall probes will not be reissued in cases where a response has not been
            received.  Probes get reissued after a user configurable timeout is reached.
            
            Added 'rira' control selector used to set the probe reissue timer (in milliseconds).

    DirtySDK (PC)
        DirtyNetWin
            Improved _SocketRecvThread() to properly deal with cases where the socket is destroyed in
            the context of the recv callback.

        NetConnWin
            Improved reliability of mechanism used to retrieve MAC address. Former solution was
            retrieving it via NetBIOS but this proved to fail when NetBIOS is disabled. New solution
            uses Microsoft IP helper API which does not depend on any protocol running.

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        NetConnPS3
            Fixed possibility of ticket size being corrupted if several SCE_NP_MANAGER_EVENT_GOT_TICKET
            notifications are received.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        ConnApiXenon
            Added DIRTY_CONNAPI_ASYNC_PROTECT which can be set to 1 to make ConnApi more resilient
            to XSessionModify failures.

        DirtySessionManagerXenon
            Fixed the implementation for cancelling overlapped operations.
            
            Fixed a potential memory leak that could occur when XUserReadStats() failed.
            
            Added DIRTY_SESSIONMANAGER_ASYNC_PROTECT which can be set to 1 to allow dynamic
            modification of the public and private session slots.

    NOTE: The ds-mw builds have been disabled while a licensing issue gets sorted out.

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        NetGameDistServ
            Providing a different kick reason (GMDIST_DESYNCED_ALL_PLAYERS) when CRC desync detection
            has to kick everybody due to a tie. This occurs if there's a tie between two groups of
            players having different CRCs.
            
    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        DirtySessionManagerXenon
            As instructed by Microsoft, XSessionDelete() is not used anymore if user is already signed
            out as session deletion is performed implicitely by the XDK during signout process.

        Xbox        --DEPRECATED--
        Xenon       XenonSDK 2.0.7978.3-proxy (November 2008)

    NOTE: The ds-mw builds have been disabled while a licensing issue gets sorted out.

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        General
            Fixed code using SocketInAddrGetText() to use SocketInAddrGetText2() to avoid possible 
            multithreading issues.
            
            Defined error codes to be used by DirtyCast game servers; for providing a disconnect 
            reason when they kick players.

        DirtyNet
            Added SocketInAddrGetText2(), which requires a user buffer and thus allows multithreaded 
            and multicall operation which SocketInAddrGetText() does not.

        ProtoHttp
            Fixed auto-redirect to close connection if requested by the server instead of resetting 
            keep-alive unconditionally.  The normal connection-close handling code is short-circuited 
            by a redirect request so it needs to be handled explicitly in a redirect case.
            
        VoipConnection
            Fixed a race condition between the voip thread closing the voip socket and the main thread 
            requesting the binding of new ports, at PG->game transition
            
    DirtySDK (ps3)
    
        NetConn
            NetConnConnect no longer automatically calls NetConnDisconnect when NetConnConnect is 
            called multiple times.  This makes it behave like the other platforms already do.

    NOTE: The ds-mw builds have been disabled while a licensing issue gets sorted out.

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)

        Voip
            Modified Voip implementation to better handle the closure of the voip Socket upon destruction of the last Voip connection. 
            Former implementation was not thread-safe and could lead to improper behavior under certain race conditions. (JIRA ticket: DIRTYSOCK-13)

    DirtySDK (Xenon)

        DirtySessionManagerXenon
            Added new control commands ‘pjoi’ and ‘pinv’ which allow you to enable\disable join by presence and join by invite.

    DirtySDK (PS3, REV, PC)

        NetConn
            Added NetConnConnect() param "peerport" that allows specification of peer port ProtoUpnp should open.

    DirtySDK (Rev)

        NetConnRev
            Added 'envi' selector to NetConnStatus(). Returns nature of EA backend environment being used (prod or dev).

    DirtySDK (Xenon)

        ConnApiXenon
            Modified implementation to now zero the rank structure before dispatching RANK_EVENT

            If using join in progress your games will not be ranked at the dirtysock level.
            This usage requires a waiver from microsoft!

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        NetGameDist
            'mwid' max packet size is now applied to the dist stream.

            Added logging of the receive CRC values.

        NetGameDistServ
            Fixed several CRC issues.

            Disabled CRC requests when there is less than two players.

        NetGameLink
            Added 'mwid' control selector which sets the maximum packet size for the stream.

            Added ping average and ping deviation to NetGameLinkStatT (returned by NetGameLinkStatus).

        ProtoHttp
            Refactored to split request header formatting and setting into distinct operations.

            Added ProtoHttpCheckKeepAlive() which checks whether a request for the given Url would be a
            keep-alive transaction.

            Fixed a bug with chunked downloads where a chunk header spanning the internal buffer boundary would
            stall the transfer.

        ProtoHttpManager
            High-level module designed to create and manage a pool of ProtoHttp refs.  A client application
            can submit rapid-fire http requests and ProtoHttpManager will distribute them efficiently across
            the ref pool internally, queuing them for efficient use of keep-alive and pipelining requests
            where possible.  Pipelining is still todo at this time.

        ProtoSSL
            Improved error handling.

        QosApi
            Added 'cbfp' control selector which sets the callback of the QosApi ref.

            Fixed a bug where the socket wasn't being set to NULL when it failed to bind to a port.

        WebOffer
            Added "UID" tag to the setup string which holds the user's platform UID value.

    DirtySDK (PC)
        DirtyNetWin
            Added some debug output that reports when we attempt to sendto using an invalid socket.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        DirtySessionManagerXenon
            Added handling for the JoinInProgress flag.

            Fixed a bug in the 'sflg' control selector.

            Added debugging information.

        VoipConnection
            Improved connection sharing.

        VoipXenon
            Improved connection sharing.

        NetConnXenon
            Added new 'rapc' selector to NetConnControl. This selector can be used to register a callback 
            that will be invoked by DirtySDK while waiting for XSessionDelete() operation to complete as
            it cannot be canceled.

        DirtySessionManagerXenon
            Implemented mechanism to allow for easy submission of TrueSkill stats.

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        VoipPS3
            Switched back to DVI as the default PS3 codec.

    NOTE: The ds-mw builds have been disabled while a licensing issue gets sorted out.

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        CommUDP
            CommUDPConnect and CommUDPListen now use the SocketInfo 'ladr' selector for their socket sharing code.

        ConnApi
            Added new ConnApiUserInfoT.uGamePort and ConnApiUserInfoT.uVoipPort fields.  If these are initialized
            to non-zero values, they will be used as the connect port instead of the global game/voip connect
            ports that ConnApi is initialized with.

            Added new demangler functionality, where we choose a psuedo-random port generated base on MAC address
            instead of the defined game port once demangling is complete.  This specifically fixes an issue with
            the Nintendo Wii wi-fi adapter and Windows ICS and is compiled in only for the Wii platform at this
            time.

            Fixes for demangling when using tunnel.

            Fixed to use tunnel port for UPnP, if tunnel is enabled.

            Changes for Host Migration and Ranked Rematch.

        ProtoPing
            Fixed a bug where a ping timeout would result in 65535 being returned from ProtoPingResponse() instead
            of -1 (Revolution only).

        ProtoSSL
            Fixed a bug where receiving a very small TCP packet (four bytes or less) at the start of an SSL packet
            frame would cause ProtoSSL to get into a state where the transaction would not complete.  This was
            observed under a simulated bandwidth constraint and is unlikely to happen in a real networking
            environment.

        ProtoTunnel
            Added 'bind' control selector (recreates tunnel socket bound to the specified port) and 'rprt' selector
            (sets remote tunnel port for specified tunnel) for use in demangling situations.

        ProtoUpnp
            Added a fix for routers that include a URLBase field with a trailing slash, and also have leading slashes
            in their control URLs.  Previously, the straight concatenation of these fields would result in a
            double-slash and cause the request to fail.  This was discovered on and the fix tested against a BT Voyager
            2400 ADSL modem.

        QosApi
            Added QosApiServiceRequest2 which takes in a probe port which gets sent to the server.

            Fixed an issue where we were incorrectly converting the firewall http response ips from network to host
            order instead of just using the value.

        VoipCodec
            VoipCodecCreate() now does nothing if the codec is already created.

    DirtySDK (PC)
        DirtyNetWin
            Added 'ladr' info selector which gets the local address previously by the user.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        ConnApiXenonSessionManager
            Added.  Handles DirtySessionManagerXenon for ConnApiXenon so that we can have two sessions.

        NetConnXenon
            NetConnQuery will now return the user index of the user in the list when NetConnQuery(NULL, NULL, 0)
            is called.

        QosApiXenon
            QosApiCreate now uses the first user's address information instead of DirtyAddrGetLocalAddr.

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        ConnApi
            Fixed a padding issue in the ConnApiRefT structure.

            Added 'ordr' status selector which returns your position in the list of allocated players.

        NetGameDist
            Now uses larger packets for steam to improve efficiency.

        NetGameDistServ
            Fixed server-side CRC checking for single player mode.

        QosApi
            QosApiServiceRequest now uses ProtoNameAsync instead of ProtoNameSync.  This means that
            QosApiServiceRequest is no longer blocking.

        VoipDVI
            Fixed an issue where DVI was incorrectly calculating the output modifier which resulted
            in clicking instead of voice.

            'plvl' control selector now takes in a fractional integer for the output power level adjustment
            instead of a float.

        VoipPCM
            'plvl' control selector now takes in a fractional integer for the output power level adjustment
            instead of a float.

    DirtySDK (PC)
        VoipPC
            Added 'plvl' control selector which takes in a float via the void pointer, converts it to
            fractional integer 16, and passes the fractional integer through to the codecs to set the output
            power level.

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        HLBudApiPS3
            Fixed a bug where a debug trace could erroneously access an out of bounds array index.

        VoipPS3
            'celp' is now the default PS3 codec.

    DirtySDK (Unix)
        DirtyNetUnix
            SocketInfo with the 'addr' selector now uses the Blaze implementation of address determination.

        NetConnUnix
            NetConnStatus with the 'addr' selector now expects a valid value for iData.  iData should
            contain the subnet to check within for the address to be returned.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        NetConnXenon
            Added language mappings for Chinese, Polish, and Russian.

    VoipAux
        VoipSpeex
            'plvl' control selector now takes in a fractional integer for the output power level adjustment
            instead of a float.

          RevolutionSDK was updated from 3.1-patch4-080227 to 3.2-patch2-20080730a.

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        ProtoHttp
            Rewrote header parsing to use extractor functions to get header field values.  This fixes
            issues where the previous header field parsing code was not fully compliant with regards
            to handling whitespace prior to the header field value, as well as header fields spanning
            multiple lines.

            Added ProtoHttpGetHeaderValue() and ProtoHttpGetNextHeader(), to aid in user parsing of
            header fields from server responses.

            Fixed to use the minimal URI ("/") when no URI is included in the http request
            (e.g. "http://somehost.com").

            Fixed a bug where a chunked transfer with keep-alive would not correctly terminate, which
            would cause the client to think the transaction had not ended and eventually time out.

            Updated client version number.

        ProtoSsl
            Added support for OBJ_md2WithRSAEncryption signature hash algorithm, used by some older
            root CA certificates.

            Fixed a bug where a memory overrun of the internal receive buffer could occur.  The receive
            buffer was allocated 16k but other standard SSL solutions allocate an additional 1k for
            encryption overhead, so now we do as well.  In addition an overflow check was implemented
            to simply break the connection instead of stomping memory if a packet is too large to be
            received in the current footprint.

            Refactored internal parsing and validation code to allow proper handling of certificate
            chain.

            Added wildcard hostname matching which is required by some certificates.

            Added comparison of OU field when matching a cert to its CA.  In addition, when there are
            multiple OU objects they are concatenated together, as some CAs include multiple objects
            and cannot be uniquely identified from other CAs without all fields available.

            Added support for parsing utf8string objects.

            Added ability to parse multiple .pem certs from one buffer to ProtoSSLSetCACert().

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        VoipXenon
            Added XAudio2 support.  To enable define VOIP_USE_XAUDIO2 in your build script before
            compiling DirtySDK.

    VoipAux
        VoipSpeex
            VAD and DTX is now the default behavior for Speex.  To disable define VOIPSPEEX_DTX as 0
            before compiling VoipAux.

            Speex preprocessor can now be enabled by defining VOIPSPEEX_PREPROCESS as 1 before
            compiling VoipAux.

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        CryptMD2
            Added support for cryptmd2.

        NetGameDist
            Added large packet support.

            Added single player support.

            Added 'spam' control selector.  Calling this with the proper value enables more verbose
            logging to use when debugging.  Only works in a debug build.

            Added server-side desync-testing.

        NetGameDistServ
            Added configuration option for auto-throttling traffic.

        ProtoHttp
            Fixed a buffer overrun in 'locn' selector output.  'locn' now returns the size of the
            required string when the output buffer and size are null and zero, respectively.

        ProtoUpnp
            Added 'extn' status selector which returns the external (WAN) IP address if available.

    DirtySDK (PC)
        VoipHeadsetPC
            Fixed a bug where the active device's index was not correctly being updated when devices
            were removed or added to the system.

            VoipHeadsetStatus 'idev' and 'odev' selectors now expect a valid buffer to be passed in
            when called via VoipStatus.  The buffer is used to store the device name.  The return
            value is now the index requested.

        Xbox        --DEPRECATED--
        Xenon       XenonSDK 2.0.7978.3-proxy (November 2008)

    NOTE: Updated to VisualStudio 8.0.50727.806-sp1-proxy.

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        ConnApi
            Fixed an issue where demangle was using the game/voip port instead of the tunnel port when
            tunnel was enabled.

        VoipCodec
            Added 'plvl' control selector which sets the volume output level.  This control passes
            through to the codec being used (dvi, pcm).

    DirtySDK (PC)
        VoipPC
            Moved the initialization of the LocalStatus and Broadband values from VoipConnect to
            VoipStartup.  This prevents those values from being reset everytime a call to VoipConnect
            is issued.

        VoipHeadsetPC
            Moved the closing and changing of input and output devices to VoipHeadsetProcess so that
            the devices cannot close or change while a read or write was occurring.

            Added 'cide' and 'code' control selectors.  'cide' closes the input device while 'code'
            closes the output device.

            Changed 'idev' and 'odev' to now set that the device is to be changed rather than attempt
            to change it straight away.  The change will occur during the next VoipHeadsetProcess call.

    VoipAux
        VoipSpeex
            Added preprocessor code, disabled by default.

            Each decoder now has a dedicated SpeexBits to use while decoding.  This prevents decoding
            from interfering with encoding and vice versa.

            Added VoipSpeexControl function with support for the 'plvl' control selector.


DirtySock SDK 7.1.2 - February 26, 2009

    This SDK release was built using the following compiler packages:
    
        EA Config   1.27.00
        Framework   2.14.00

                    VisualStudio 8.0.0-2-non-proxy
        Xbox        --DEPRECATED--
        Xenon       XenonSDK 2.0.7978.3-proxy (November 2008)

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        ConnApi
            Enhancements for DirtyCast ProtoTunnel support.

            Fixed an issue where the ProtoTunnel port information was not getting copied to the UserInfo
            structure.

        DirtyNet
            Fixed an issue where memcpy was being used instead of strncpy which could have resulted in
            reading from an invalid address.

        ProtoHttp
            Fixed a bug that prevented the max auto-redirection limit from working.

            Added 'locn' status selector which returns the most recent Location: header from a server
            response, if any is available

            Added ProtoHttpCallback2 which can be used to set a callback to be issued when a header is
            received from a server.

        ProtoStream
            Fixed a bug in ProtoStreamRead where it was incorrectly returning the bytes read as a negative
            value.

        ProtoTunnel
            Added per-tunnel uLocalClientId values for use in situations where the prototunnel module can
            represent multiple groupings.  The per-tunnel uLocalClientId value is used in place of the
            global value if it is non-zero.

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        ProtoSSL
            Fixed an issue where CryptRSA was calculating an incorrect key modulus size and the signature
            hash was not decrypting correctly.


DirtySock SDK 7.1.0 - February 3, 2009

        Xbox        --DEPRECATED--
        Xenon       XenonSDK 2.0.7978.3-proxy (November 2008)

    NOTE: Updated to Framework 2.14.00. XenonSDK was updated from 2.0.7776.0 to 2.0.7978.3.

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        ConnApi
            Added 'vrst' control selector which forces all VOIP connections back to the INIT state.

        LobbyBase64
            Updated LobbyBase64Decode() to be able to skip whitespace characters embedded in the base64
            input stream.  This allows for easier processing of basee64-encoded output that includes line
            breaks as recommended by the RFC.  Non-base64 characters included in the input stream will
            still result in a decoder error.

            Modified LobbyBase64Decode() to allow a NULL output pointer.  If called in this way, the full
            decode process is executed but does not write any data.  This is useful for verification of data
            and returning output size without writing any output.

        NetGameDist
            Added debug logging of the index and number of players in NetGameDistMultiSetup().

        ProtoHttp
            Added new functions ProtoHttpAddCACert() and ProtoHttpClrCACerts().

        ProtoSSL
            Added new function ProtoSSLAddCACert(), which will add a CA certificate to the list of allowed
            certificates.  The input certificate must be in DER or PEM format.  Only a subset of signature
            algorithms are supported so not all certificates will work out of the box.

            Added new function ProtoSSLClrCACerts().  This function clears all dynamically added CA
            certificates added with ProtoSSLAddCACert().

            Added ability to ignore client validation (debug only) dynamically instead of as a compile-time
            constant; use ProtoSSLControl('ncrt') selector.

        ProtoTunnel
            Bumped up ProtoTunnelRefT.iNumTunnels and ProtoTunnelRefT.iMaxTunnels from 8bit signed integers
            to 32bit signed integers, to allow more than 127 maximum tunnels at a time.

        VoipTunnel
            Added VoipTunnelClientT.uTunnelId field, for optional use by application when using ProtoTunnel
            in conjunction with VoipTunnel.

    DirtySDK (PC)
        DirtyNetWin
            Fixed to not poll invalid sockets (-1 socket id).

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        DirtyErrPS3
            Added DirtyErrNameList() and DirtyErrGetNameList().
            
        DirtyNetPS3
            Fixed debug print of gethostbyname() error result to use error codes specific to that function.
            
            Added SocketInfo() 'audt' selectors (debug only) for verbose output of network status.
            
        NetConnPS3
            Added NetConnControl() 'audt' selector (debug only) to set up a network status debug dump, which
            can be one-shot or recurring.

        Xbox        --DEPRECATED--
        Xenon       XenonSDK 2.0.7776.0-proxy (August 2008)

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        ProtoTunnel
            Fixed an issue where ProtoTunnel incorrectly assumed that the address for a UDP send
            would not be NULL.
        
        Voip
            Fixed the voip connection sharing implementation (aka voip de-import). Connections to
            all VoipGroups were erroneously being removed when the connection was removed from a
            single VoipGroup.
        
        VoipGroup
            Fixed a bug where connection 0 was not getting removed when VoipGroupClear was called.

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        NetConnPS3
            Added 'envi' status selector which returns the run-time env in use (test, cert, prod).

    DirtySDK (xenon)
        NetConnXenon
            Fixed the 'invt' status selector. The controller index on which the accept invite
            notification was notified was not taken into account properly.
        
        VoipXenon
            Modified VOIP implementation such that a user who leaves their userset yet remains in

Changes/bugfixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        ConnApi
            Removal of the connapi import param in ConnApiHost, ConnApiconnect and ConnApiAddClient.
            Import is now automatic when it is possible, and not done otherwise.
            Added mechanism to de-import, i.e. leaving a game and returning to playgroup voip.
    
        Dirtymem
            Change to DirtySock memory allocation API. Added new user data pointer to API functions.
            MemGgoupEnter takes an extra pointer.
            DirtyMemAlloc and DirtyMemFree receives the passed in pointer.
            MemGroupQuery takes a [out] pointer to the memgroup and to the userdata. 
            NULL can be safely passed in to MemGroupQuery.
            
        NetGameLink
            Allowing link and dist traffic to go alongside. NetGameLinkRecv now takes an extra param.
            Pass FALSE to indicate you don't want dist packets. Only NetGameDist (internal to DirtySDK)
            can pass in TRUE.
            
        NetGameDist
            Coding standard changes: NetGameDistStreamInpT, NetGameDistStreamT, members name changed.
            
            NetGameDistInputTweak replaced by NetGameDistControl.
            
            NetGameDistRecvProc taking an extra uint8_t param: bDist to indicate the need to receive
            dist packets.

        ProtoTunnel
            Further fixed an issue where an out of order packet was incorrectly causing ProtoTunnel to
            rematch the tunnel key instead of just discarding the packet.
  
        QosApi
            Removed queuing code. Added parallel service request capabilities         
            
        Voip
            Added local headset status to voip packets, retreivable with VoipRemote() and VOIP_REMOTE_HEADSETOK
            
            Not sending DISC packet to peer in response to incoming DISC packets. Should have minimal
            impact. Will be revisited in the new year.
            
        Samples            
            dirtysdk-samples are on by default; you can disable/enable them by passing in 
            -D:dirtysdk-samples=false/true

    DirtySDK (PC)
        DirtyNetWin
            Offering 'xclr' control to clear the remap tables.
            
        NetConnWin
            NetConnStartup accepts "-noupnp" to disable upnp.
            
        VoipPC
            Missing 'serv' selector added in VoipControl. Fixes GameServer use case.
            
        VoipConnection
            Not setting the uRecvMask on connections for which we skipped the register. Burnout request.
    
    DirtySDK (PS2)
        Deprecated

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        NetConnPS3
            Removed dependency on the commerce API in the PS3 SDK.

    DirtySDK (rev)
        DirtyNetRev
            Improved robustness of socket initialization. 
            
            Changed priority _of _SocketStartupThread to be current-1.            

    DirtySDK (xbox)
        Deprecated

    DirtySDK (xenon)
        ConnApiXenon
            Mutual connect. Both sides will now attempt voip and game connections. 
            
            Offering 'vsrv' selector to allow voip through a Dedicated Server
            
            Allowing the selection of public and private slots. ConnApiUserInfoT.uClientFlags 
            must be set for each client. Use 0 for old behaviour, or one of
            CONNAPI_FLAG_PUBLICSLOT
            CONNAPI_FLAG_PRIVATESLOT
            to pick the type of slot to use.
            
        DirtySessionManagerXenon
            DirtySessionManagerConnect and DirtySessionManagerControl('conn') now take
            DIRTYSESSIONMANAGER_FLAG_PUBLICSLOT
            DIRTYSESSIONMANAGER_FLAG_PRIVATESLOT
            to pick the type of slot to use.
            
        NetConnXenon
            Better handling of Friends Invites. Addresses eatech 117738.
            
            Using 'xclr' (see above) control to clear the remap tables, upon NetConnConnect.
