New in this release:
    DirtySDK (All)
        ConnApi
            Added a new control selector 'dtif' that can be used to override the default timeout value for XB1
            security association creation or the demangling timeout on other platforms (in a cc-assisted or failover
            context).

       DirtyNet
            Added support for TCP keep-alive settings using the 'keep' control.  In some environments we need to be able
            to tweak the keep-alive settings to ensure that firewalls and other external parties do not close our
            connections without notifying us.

            Added SocketHostnameCacheDel, which deletes an entry from the hostname cache (internal use only).

            Added debug print when a lookup is refcounted.

        NetConn
            Added ability to allow users to override the cpu affinity of our internal threads with a netconn startup
            param "-affinity".

        Platform
            Added ds_strtoull function to convert strings to uint64_t.

            Added support for using EABase to drive the platform.h defines.

        ProtoSSL
            Added support for the ALPN extension (Application Level Protocol Negotiation) on both the client & server
            side.  This extension helps negotiate a protocol between the client & server; see the spec at
            https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7301.

            Added ProtoSSLControl() 'resu' selector, to enable/disable SSL session resume (enabled by default,
            preserving previous behavior).

            Added support for setting the keep alive settings for the TCP socket. To support this I've added
            an 'skep' option and followed the same pattern as the other socket options that we set for this module.

        QosApi
            Added ability to configure much of qosapi with QosApiControl, via the BlazeSDK util component this provides
            us with many options to tweak QOS behaviors post ship.  New selectors are:
            'bpco' - if used overrides config from server, this will be the number of bandwidth probes used for tests
            'bpso' - if used overrides config from server, this will be the size of bandwidth probes used for tests
            'isyt' - sets the maximum number of ms to wait to initially synchronize all latency requests
            'lpco' - if used overrides config from server, this will be the number of latency probes used for tests
            'pque' - passed to SocketControl 'pque' if not 0, otherwise the numpackets will be passed to SocketControl
                     'pque'
            'rbuf' - passed to SocketControl 'rbuf'
            'repc' - sets the number of extra probes sent (in addition to those which received no response) on a re-issue
            'sado' - set the override address to send the http requests to when issuing a service request, overrides
                     parameter passed to QosApiServiceRequest
            'salp' - if TRUE use old logic of sending all latency probes at once (default FALSE)
            'sbuf' - passed to SocketControl 'sbuf'
            'sprt' - set the override port to send the http requests to when issuing a service request, overrides
                     parameter passed to QosApiServiceRequest
            'tgbp' - sets the minimum number of ms between sending latency probes to the same site.
            'ussl' - if TRUE use https else http for setup communication (defaults TRUE)

    DirtySDK (PS4)
        DirtySessionManagerPS4
            Added new status selectors for PlayTogther support. New selectors are:
            'pthe' - poll this selector to check if the client has received the PlayTogether event
            'ptil' - if a PlayTogether event has been received use this selector to retrieve the invite list            
        
        NetConnPS4
            Added a new startup parameter "-checktick" on PS4 to control how we initialize DirtyEventManager.  The new
            startup parameter will control if we fail our initialization of DirtyEventManager in the case that we have
            potentially missed events because the EASystemEventMessageDispatcher has been ticked. By default we will
            not check if the dispatcher has been ticked so teams don't need to worry about aligning the startup of the
            two systems.

        ProtoHttpPS4
            Added protohttpps4 for native support of HTTP and SSL.
            
    DirtySDK (XboxOne)
        NetConnXboxOne
            Added extra mapping from sandbox to environment to prevent having the title download storage figure out the
            environment:
            * EARW.3 -> CERT
            * XDP1.0 -> PROD (EA Access Testing)

Changes/fixes in this release:
    DirtySDK (ALL)
        Build
            Changed to set the optionset to the C++ build type when building those types of files.  With newer packages
            we see that our C++ files were trying to be built as C and causing us to generate some compiler errors due
            to that.

        ConnApi
            Changed to move the virtualization of ports to be handled at the connapi layer instead of having the
            network adapter deal with it.

        DirtyCert
            Changed to move DirtyCert updating to the internal NetLib idle thread.  To make integration easier for our
            customers, this makes it possible to use ProtoHttp without the need to poll NetConnIdle.  The major
            requirement that ProtoHttp depended on was DirtyCert, which needs to be updated in case we needed to pull
            down any CA certs.

        DirtyNet
            Fixed to no longer refcount HostentT refs that are in the list but are in a done state.

        JsonParse
            Fixed crash issue parsing json with leading whitespace.

        ProtoHttp
            Fixed a bug in both ProtoHttpGetNextHeader() and ProtoHttpFindHeaderValue(), when dealing with an empty
            header.

        ProtoHttpServ
            Fixed an issue which could lead an http client to hang indefinately or until timeout when the client
            requested a keep-alive.

            Fixed a cert cache issue where it was possible to reconnect to a server with a cached cert using IP address
            instead of name.

        ProtoTunnel
            Fixed to initialize the sockaddr used in _ProtoTunnelRecvCallback to prevent address translation spam.

        QosApi
            Changed to improve latency tests accuracy in poor network conditions; latency is now done in parallel
            across all ping sites, preventing random lag spikes from effecting one result.

            Changed to improve logging by making it more configurable with QosApiControl('spam') - set the verbosity of
            the module, default 1 (0 errors, 1 debug info, 2 extended debug info, 3 per probe info).

            Changed public APIs QosApiCreate and QosApiServiceRequest to simplify API and better reflect data types
            being passed.

            Removed unused defines QOSAPI_STATUS_XB_*, QOSAPI_LISTENFL_*, and QOSAPI_RESPONSE_MAXSIZE.

            Removed and replaced QOSAPI_REQUESTFL_* with QosApiRequestTypeE.

        VoipConnection
             Fixed coverity warning about potential out of bound access of pConnection->VoipMicrPacket[] array when
             user index is VOIP_SHARED_USER_INDEX (0xFF on PC).

             Fixed a bug in use of memset, which resulted in target buffer not being cleared.

        VoipTunnel
            Removed deprecated flags and fields that were set for deprecation since v9
            * VOIPTUNNEL_CLIENTFLAG_BROADCASTING_VOICE
            * VOIPTUNNEL_GAMEFLAG_MAX_VOICES_REACHED
            * VoipTunnelGameT.iNumClientsBroadcasting

        XmlFormat
            Fixed access to unitialized variable coverity warning.

    DirtySDK (PS4)
        DirtySessionManagerPS4
            Fixed to try to catch configuration errors with dirtysessionmanager as we want to send failures back to
            bring it to the attention of integrators.

            Fixed an issue where the return value was not properly being set because of a bad enclosure of assignment.

    DirtySDK (Unix)
        Build
            Removed voiptunnel.c from unix specific sources as this is already part of main source list.

        DirtyNetUnix
            Fixed _SocketLookupThread to prefer IPv6 addresses, when available.  This fixes compatibility with iOS10.

            Fixed SocketConnect to scrub a hostname cache entry when connect() returns an EHOSTUNREACH error.  This
            type of error happens when switching from an IPv4 to an IPv6 connection or vice versa.

    DirtySDK (XboxOne)
        Build
            Changed to use sdkreferences task when depending on any of the extension assemblies on XboxOne.

        ProtoMangleXboxOne
            Fixed a potential issue where an IPv6 user mapping might get updated instead of added.

        NetConnXboxOne
            Fixed to handle the AsyncStatus::Started case when calling DownloadBlobAsync.  FIFA was seeing instances
            where we would crash when getting a AsyncStatus::Started due to the fact that we don't handle and just kill
            the async operation.  After discussing this with Microsoft their suggestion was just to ignore this status
            as you should expect to get another callback when the operation actually finishes.
           
            Fixed an issue were a failed environment check would not properly trigger a retry, leaving netconn stuck in
            ~env state indefinitely.

New in this release:
    DirtySDK (All)
        ProtoSSL
            Added 'rsao' selector to signal that there is currently an RSA operation ongoing.
     
Changes/fixes in this release:
    DirtySDK (All)
        ProtoTunnel
            Fixed a knock-on  in cl 1174902 when faced with discarding an out-of-order packet that could not be recovered. This would cause a stream reset that broke the connection. 
            This fix reverts part of that change to make the out-of-order packet discard safe and not break the connection. In doing so it undoes the original fix, meaning some other resolution for that issue will be required moving forward.
     
    DirtySDK (PC)
        VoipPC
            Fixed intermittently broken voip on PC caused by bad initialization of the VoIP user identifier.
        
    DirtySDK (Unix)
        NetConnUnix
            Added check for NULL terminator when parsing the `/proc/cpuinfo` in the case we have a truncated string (does not include \n)

Changes/fixes in this release:
    DirtySDK (PS4)
        DirtySessionManagerPS4
            Changed DirtySessionManager to better catch configuration errors and service it back to integrators.

        VoipHeadsetPS4
            Fixed _VoipHeadsetUpdateChatPrivileges() to ignore non-participating user.  This fix is necessary to comply with TRC R4061G in PS4-TestCase_for_TRC1.5_e stating: A non-voip-restricted user in a
            game should not see his voip blocked because of a voip-restricted user signed-in on the console but not participating in the game.

    DirtySDK (XboxOne)
        NetConnXboxOne
            Fixed potential crash in the lambda expression performed when the DownloadBlobAsync()  operation completes with completion status AsyncStatus::Canceled.
            The code incorrectly uses a reference that was invalidated when the operation cancellation was initiated.

        ProtoHttpXboxOne
            Fixed a potential external cleanup issue by adding a timeout to stop waiting for the E_ABORT that might never come. Instead after 5 second time we will fake the E_ABORT Event ourselves.

    DirtySDK (Unix)
        DirtyNetUnix
            Removed the use of  AI_V4MAPPED flag when ai_family is AF_UNSPEC.

New in this release:
    DirtySDK (All)
        Build
            Enabled shadow variable warnings on targets that doesn't set this by default.

        DirtyLib
            Added NetPrintRateLimit, implementing automated rate limiting of redundant lines of NetPrintf output.
            Identical sequences of lines are suppressed for up to 100ms, or when a new line of text is printed.
            The number of suppressions is appended to the line of text.  Lines of text over 256 characters are
            not rate-limited.

        DirtyNet
            Added SocketPacketQueueStatus('full') to query if socket inbound packet queue is full or not.

            Added SocketPacketQueueStatus('size') to query current size (in packets) of socket inbound packet queue.

            Added IPv6 support definitions and includes.

            Added SocketAddressMap functionality, moved here from dirtynetxboxone, for general IPv6 support.  IPv6
            addresses are mapped to pseudo-IPv4 addresses for public consumption.

        NetConn
            Added standard error code for NetConnStartup.

        ProtoHttpServ
            Added function to log via the logging callback at varying verbosity levels.

        ProtoSSL
            Added debug output of certificate signature type when validating a certificate.

        QosApi
            Added code to leverage the new support for SocketControl('pque') on physical sockets (non-virtual). QosApi
            is now using a socket with a 10-deep recv paquet queue to eliminate the possibility of inducing artificial
            latency resulting from inbound latency probes remaining in the system socket receive buffer because the
            1-deep queue was full. (Happens when the critical section cannot be entered in the recv callback registered
            by qosapi - _QosApiRecvCB())

    DirtySDK (Android/iOS/PC/Unix/XboxOne)
        DirtyNetWin
            Added IPv6 support, switched to using IPv6 sockets internally, leveraging dual-protocol stack functionality
            to continue to support IPv4.  Added IPv6 name resolution support to SocketLookup().  IPv4 names continue
            to be preferred when available.

    DirtySDK(WinRT)
        DirtyNet
            Added new define INADDR_LOOPBACK for WinRT configurations

    DirtySDK(XboxOne)
        NetConnXboxOne
            Added a new XBLWait state so make sure we wait for the connectivity level to become xbox live.

Changes/fixes in this release:
    DirtySDK (All)
        Build
            Moved the contents of dirtysock-initialize.xml to Initialize.xml file and tell the package to
            initializeself. This makes it so the package will include Initialize.xml automatically without us needing
            to do it explicitly.

            Changed implementation to now export the DIRTYCODE_LOGGING defines based on the
            dirtysdk_debug_enable / dirtysdk_debug_disable build properties.

            Removed hhc.exe from the SDK and depend on the userdoc package to provide this when building documentation.

            Removed unused macro / defines

            Removed unused release build scripts

        ConnApi
            Fixed the GameServer's bAllocated flag to be correctly set TRUE during client initialization.

        CryptGCM
            Fixed crash in _CryptGcmDecrypt() when passed a negative length.  This condition is rare and has been seen
            when an SSL server incorrectly sends an unencrypted alert message when aborting a connection.

        DirtyLib
            Changed to move/consolidate NetPrintfCode and NetPrintfHook to dirtylib from platform-specific files.

            Moved DIRTY_TOKEN_PASTE and DIRTY_CONCATENATE_HELPER here from dirtynet.h as a better fit.

        DirtyNet
            Fixed implementation to skip empty hostname cache entries before checking for expiration, to eliminate
            confusing debug output.

            Refactored recv path for physical sockets (non-virtual):
              * Replaced hard-coded 1-deep queue with configurable n-deep queue.
              * Performed appropriate changes for all flavors (win, x1, ps4, unix) to be as close as possible
                (eliminated unjustified platform specificities)
              * Simplified recv path logic in terms of what is done in the context of SocketrecvFrom() vs in the
                context of socketrecvthread

            Standardized verbosity tracking and usage (spam levels).

        JsonParse
            Added handling for JSON strings inside of JsonSeekObjectEnd.

        Plat-str
            Cleanup and better support of IPv6 address printing.

        ProtoAdvt
            Fixed a couple of places that didn't initialize a sockaddr struct before use.

        ProtoHttpServ
            Changed all the logging to use the logging callback so we get in the applications that run this module.

        ProtoSSL
            Fixed a bug when requesting an SSLv3 connection where the requested cipher list would be empty, causing
            the connection to fail.  This is only relevant to test setups as DirtySDK clients do not request SSLv3
            by default.

        ProtoTunnel
            Removed tunnel mode concept from prototunnel.

    DirtySDK (PC)
        DirtyNetWin
            Removed DirtyNetXboxOne. Consolidated win and xboxone implementations in a single file called DirtyNetWin
            to achieve reduction of code duplication.

        VoipConnection
            Fixed the voip data to not be processed if there is no listening device attached to prevent TTY spam on PC.

    DirtySDK (PS4)
        Build
            Removed unsupported defines as part of the PS4 3.500 SDK upgrade. The ORBIS_SDK_VERSION was replaced by
            SCE_ORBIS_SDK_VERSION.

            Removed very old version checks that are no longer needed.

            Removed the privilege checks for asynchronous multiplayer as this is not supported on the newer SDK.

            Changed implementation to now set the config-vs-version on PS4 to support the use case of Frostbite titles.
            Make sure to only set the VS2015 compiler flags for vc compilers.

            Fixed PS4 compiler warnings introduced in the PS4 3.500 upgrade, reported by a customer (Unreachable code
            and checking NULL on arrays).

        DirtyNetPS4
            Added handling of sceNpWebApiDeleteRequest failures.

        DirtySessionManagerPS4
            Fixed potential mem leaks caused by the changeable data never being released when it exists.

            Fixed implementation of DirtySessionManagerControl('gchg') to invoke
            _DirtySessionManagerSetChangeableSessionData() instead of _DirtySessionManagerSetSessionData().

        DirtyWebApiPS4
            Changed where iThreadLife is set to DirtyWebApiCreate (main thread).

        NetConn
            Fixed implementation to check the result code of sceAppContentAppParamGetInt() when querying for trial
            status.

        UserApiPS4
            Fixed a double counting problem when a first party query fails.

    DirtySDK (XboxOne)
        Build
            Fixed compiler warnings introduced by upgrading to the March XDK.
              * Fixed shadow variable usage in 'poll' selector (dirtynetxboxone)
              * Fixed an incorrect implementation of SocketRecvfrom the pBuf parameter is non-const (dirtynetxboxone)
              * Remove unused variables on platforms they are not used on (connapi, user, privilege)
              * Use a conditional instead of assigning an integer to a boolean in C++ (voipxboxone)
              * Remove printing of serialization size as that was the only use of the variable and not very helpful to
                logging.
              * Suppress warning in T2Host relating to changing of sizes between compilers and alignment attributes
              * Assign the enumeration to the correct value instead of treating it as an integer (privilege)
              * Switch from while(1) to for (;;) to prevent a constant expression warning (SampleCore)
              * Remove unused variable (connapi, SampleCore)

        DirtyLibWin
            Changed to statically initialize nettick frequency to a safe value, so any calls to NetTick() on Xbox One
            before NetConnStartup() will not crash.

        DirtyNetXboxOne
            Switched to using DirtyNet functions for Address Map functionality that were previously internal.

            Removed DirtyNetXboxOne. Consolidated win and xboxone implementations in a single file called DirtyNetWin
            to achieve reduction of code duplication.

        VoipHeadsetXboxOne
            Refactored bad rep check query to use normal lambda expressions.

    *** Important - Xbox One XSAPI 2.0 Support ***
    This version of DirtySDK supports XSAPI 2.0 which is not backwards compatible with XSAPI 1.0.
    Integrators will need to build against XSAPI 2.0.

    *** Important - ConnApi client uId of 0 is now considered invalid ***
    ConnApi client with a uId of 0 will now be consider invalid and will be ignore by ConnApi.

    *** Important - First DirtySDK version compatible with the Connection Concierge feature ***
    This version of DirtySDK includes a large amount of changes that were introduced specifically for interoperability
    with the Connection Concierge tech (https://docs.developer.ea.com/display/TEAMS/Connection+Concierge+Project).
    Regardless of your game leveraging Connection Concierge or not, those changes should be transparent to you.

New in this release:
    DirtySDK (All)
        CommUdp
            Added backwards-compatible update to protocol to allow versioning, defined previous version as 1.0 and new
            version as 1.1.

            Added larger subpacket support (increased from a maximum of 250 bytes to 1530 bytes) for connections
            negotiated to commudp protocol version 1.1 or higher.  Subpackets requiring 250 bytes or fewer continue to
            use one byte of encoding, while larger subpackets require two bytes.  This allows packet redundancy, when
            combined with raising the default redundancy limit, for larger packets.

        ConnApi
            Added the ability to specify a user index when activating the P2P connection forced failure debug
            option ('!res'). Setting the index to -1 will affect all users like the old behavior.

            Added support for hosted connections (obtained from Connection Concierge). New code paths were added
            to use connection IDs received from Connection Concierge when setting up game connections, voip
            connections and tunnels. Related public api changes:
             * Added multiple new fields to ConnApiClientInfoT.
             * Added CONNAPI_CCMODE_* defines.
             * Added a new 'ccmd' control selector to specify the Connection Concierge mode associated with
               the connapi instance.

        DirtyNet
            Added prints to track virtual port addition and deletion.

            Added packet drop and packet high water to packet queue.

            Added SocketInfo() 'pdrp' and 'pmax' selectors.

        JsonParse
            Added support for JSON payloads greater than 64k.

            Added support for JsonParse taking a length of -1, in which case strlen is used to calculate the size of
            the input JSON buffer.

            Added support for JsonParse to take a null parse buffer, in which case the size in bytes required for the
            parse buffer are calculated and returned.

        ProtoHttpServ
            Added support for a 'spam' control to control the amount of logging with do within the module.

            Added a request timeout to cover situations where the remote side stops sending or receiving, defaulting
            to 30 seconds.

            Added a ProtoHttpServControl('idle') selector to set the idle/keep-alive timeout.

            Added PROTOHTTPSERV_FLAG_LOOPBACK.

            Added ProtoHttpServCreate2() which has an additional uFlags parameter.

        ProtoTunnel
            Added a new 'actv' status selector to get the number of active tunnels on based on a specific prototunnel
            version.

            Added a new 'vset' status selector to get a comma delimited list of versions we support to report to the
            CCS.

            Added PROTOTUNNEL_VERSION, PROTOTUNNEL_VERSION_MIN, PROTOTUNNEL_VERSION_MAX to the public header file.

        Voip
            Added support for one way muting.

        VoipCommon
            Added a new 'vcid' control selector to assign a local 32-bit identifier to a specific voip connection.

        VoipConnection
            Added support for hosted connections (obtained from Connection Concierge). New code paths were added
            to use connection IDs received from Connection Concierge when setting up voip connections.
            Related public api changes:
                * New uRemoteClientId field added to VoipConnectionT.
                * Renamed uClientId field to uLocalClientId in VoipConnectionT.

        VoipGroup
            Added support for hosted connections (obtained from Connection Concierge). New code paths were added
            to use connection IDs received from Connection Concierge when setting up voip connections.
            Related public api changes:
                * Added VOIPGROUP_CCMODE_* defines.
                * Added a new 'ccmd' control selector to specify the Connection Concierge mode associated with
                  the voipgroup.
                * Added VoipGroupConnect2() which takes an additional bIsConnectivityHosted input parameter and an
                  additional uLowLevelConnectivityId input parameter.
                * Added VoipGroupResume2() which takes an additional uLowLevelConnectivityId input parameter. For
                  Connection Conncierge support specifically.

        VoipTunnel
            Added support for allowing voiptunnel clients to exist in multiple games. This functionality to used to
            mimic how Blaze handles clients in Games and Game Groups. Related public api changes:
                * Added VOIPTUNNEL_MAXSUSPENDED.
                * Added VoipTunnelSuspendInfoT.
                * Added iNumSuspended field to VoipTunnelClientT.

            Added support for a unique game identifier that can be specified when creating the game in the
            voiptunnel. New API functions were added to allow users to work with this identifier. Related public
            api changes:
                * Added VoipTunnelGameListAdd2().
                * Added iGameIdx input param to VoipTunnelClientListDel().
                * Added VoipTunnelGameListMatchIndex().
                * Added VoipTunnelGameListMatchId().

    DirtySDK (PS4)
        DirtyNet
            Added missing definition for INADDR_LOOPBACK for PS4, needed in protohttpserv.

        VoipHeadsetPS4
            Added the ability to configure voice lib thread attributes. You can override the settings with your
            Blazeserver util.cfg.

    DirtySDK (PS4/XboxOne)
        NetConn
            Added a new 'eusr' selector that returns the IEAUser object at a given index.

    DirtySDK (XboxOne)
        DirtyNetXboxOne
            Added functionality to remap IPv6 addresses to existing IPv4 virtual addresses. It was demonstrated that
            this update is possible in a cable pull scenario.

        ProtoMangleXboxOne
            Added processing for updates of secure associations which the are already in a completed state to update
            the IPv6 address mappings.

        Voip
            Added bad reputation auto muting support in order to better satisfy XR-086. This feature will be on by default.

Changes/fixes in this release:
    DirtySDK (All)
        Build
            Fixed doc build errors.

            Fixed warnings generated by VS2015 Update 1

            Changed the build scripts to use the config-vs-version property to better handle changing between versions
            of Visual Studio.

        ConnApi
            Fixed how we increment the client count.

            Fixed the 'cadr' selector to return the prototunnel address used.

            Removed CONNAPI_STATUS_CLSE as it is no longer used.

            Fixed an issue that caused the previous mute settings not to be properly retained when resuming a voip
            connection.

            Fixed an issue where a game group would use the wrong voip port when joining a game session, then a
            game group, then leaving the game session.

            Fixed ConnApiControl 'adve' selector, when disabling advertising, to also destroy the NetGameUtil ref
            if it has already been created.

        DirtyCert
            Fixed to not issue a redundant preload request if a preload request is already in the queue.

            Fixed a bug where a successful preload triggered by a validation failure would result in a failed
            transaction, because the subsequent on-demand request would be considered to fail due to adding a
            redundant CA.

        DirtyNet
            Fixed to include missing return in 'pque' selector that caused misleading debug warning.

            Changed packet queue max size from 127 to 1024.

        JsonFormat
            Fixed _JsonUpdateHeader() to prevent buffer offset from exceeding the buffer size during an overflow
            condition.  This fixes a possible memory stomp on a subsequent call to a JsonFormat method.

        JsonParse
            Fixed a bug when executing a JsonFind against an element in an unclosed array; the find would skip past the
            end of the parse buffer data and access uninitialized memory.

            Fixed a bug where executing a JsonFind against an unclosed element, containing a name but no value, would
            result in returning a pointer to the beginning of the Json buffer.

            Fixed some other cases where the parse buffer could be accessed after the terminator.

            Fixed one issue each in the decode and escape lookup tables.

            Fixed to ensure after calling JsonParse that the parse buffer is always zero terminated.  If this is not
            possible, zero is returned.

            Changed name of JsonGetListItemEnd to JsonGetObjectEnd to better match JSON naming conventions.  A #define
            wrapper supporting the old name is included to maintain compatibility with previous code.

        NetConn
            Fixed documentation error in header for NetConnIdle.

        Plat-time
            Fixed a bug in weekday calculation in ds_secstotime.

        ProtoHttpManager
            Fixed to use consistent modulename as prefix to debug output.

        ProtoHttpServ
            Removed code in _ProtoHttpServUpdateRecvBody() that set the received body flag true when receiving a
            chunked transfer without any initial data.

            Changed the ProtoHttpServControl('time') selector to set the request timeout.

            Fixed a typo in the default idle timeout value, which was supposed to be five minutes but was in fact much
            longer.

            Changed size of ProtoHttpServRequestT.strContentType[] from 32 to 64 to match what we use for
            ProtoHttpServResponseT

            Changed the code in the _ProtoHttpServParseHeader to skip all the URI / TYPE information that is in the header
            This fixes an issue with skipping the first valid header value when parsing

        ProtoTunnel
            Fixed two issues when attempting to switch keys.  The first issue was on the side receiving a packet
            encrypted by the new key, in ProtoTunnelValidatePacket(), which was not using the new crypto state to try
            decrypting the packet.  The second issue was on the sending side, where a new HMAC was not being calculated
            when the new key was chosen.  These issues caused failures in scenarios with players in a game and a
            gamegroup, when players left either the game or the gamegroup, and could not maintain their p2p
            connections.

            Fixed an issue where a large stream offset could cause a rematch to fail due to out-of-order discard.  The
            send stream offset is now reset to zero when a new key is selected, matching the behavior of the rematch
            code on the receive side, which already assumes a stream offset of zero.

            Fixed possible issues with crypto setup by making sure send/recv states are both initialized all of the
            time when switching keys.

            Fixed a bug which broke a reconnection scenario where one side of a connection was already active, while
            the other was not.  The bug was due to an incorrect change of hard-coded return values in
            _ProtoTunnelDecryptAndValidatePacket2(), introduced along with the addition of ProtoTunnel 1.1 protocol
            support.

            Removed usage of hard-coded values. Replaced with explicit defines for packet decrypt flow.

            Changed _ProtoTunnelDecryptAndValidatePacket() to return a VALIDATE error if an attempt to recover an out
            of order packet fails.

            Changed to implementation to simplify error returns from _ProtoTunnelRecvData() and error handling of
            values returned by that function in _ProtoTunnelRecv().

            Fixed a bug in _ProtoTunnelFindTunnel(), where a failed match of an inactive tunnel would print an error
            message, but continue on with the tunnel index as if the match had succeeded.  This would cause some
            parameters (port, addr) to be updated incorrectly before the packet was subsequently rejected, which was
            mostly harmless but could cause some confusing temporary side effects particularly in the debug printing.

            Fixed various documentation and debug printing items.

        ProtoWebSocket
            Fixed some documentation errors regarding several TODOs in the code.

        VoipCommon
            Fixed a potential memory stomp when setting voip channel information for a user index which is out of range.

            Fixed the channel selection functions to properly include attempts to modify the VOIP_SHARED_USER_INDEX.

        VoipGroup
            Fixed a bug during the transition from a gamegroup to a game so that the proper mute status from the game
            group would transfer over into the game.

        VoipTunnel
            Remove support for the 'dcst' control which was used to set a DirtyCast hack. We now support this
            functionality by default as there exists no configuration we were disable the hack.

            Fixed a possible memory leak detected by Coverity, in a situation when trying to create a VoipTunnel object
            and running out of memory.

    DirtySDK (iOS)
        Plat-time
            Fixed broken NetPrintf time stamps.

    DirtySDK (PC)
        DirtyNetWin
            Fixed the usage of the socket select() function to be compatible with Berkley sockets.

    DirtySDK (XboxOne)
        Build
            Removed support for the XboxOne ADK

        DirtyNetXboxOne
            Fixed the usage of the socket select() function to be compatible with Berkley sockets.

        NetConnXboxOne
            Fixed an issue where token acquisition did not reset properly after a cable pull and a reconnect, leading
            to a report that the token acquisition failed when it had not been attempted.

                    WindowsPhoneSDK 8.0.9900-proxy

    *** Important - DIRTYSDK_IEAUSER_ENABLED compile switch no longer supported ***
    Deprecated DIRTYSDK_IEAUSER_ENABLED compile switch such that IEAUser integration can no longer be turned off at
    compile time when using DirtySDK NetConn for PS4 or XBoxOne.

    *** Important - Gen 3 platform specific code has been removed ***
    Gen3 support was deprecated in 15.1.1.1.0. The remaining Gen 3 specific code have now been removed.

New in this release:
    DirtySDK (All)
        Build
            Added support for structured xml libs-external when Framework is version 3.33.00 or higher.

            Added support for Visual Studio 2015. To enable support the vsversion property needs to be
            set to "2015" when building as the new warning suppressions are not backwards compatible.

            Added new build property dirtysdk-contrib that allows enabling the contribs to build Without
            samples. If dirtysdk-contrib does not need to be specified when dirtysdk-samples is true.

        CryptSTP1
            Removed CryptSTP1 support.

        Displist
            Removed Displist support.

        Hasher
            Removed Hasher support.

        NetGameLink
            Added verbosity setting to reduce QoS data spam in the logs unless desired.

            Added the reception time in ticks of the packet to NetGamePacketHeadT metadata.

        ProtoHttpServ
            Added a new callback for processing the incoming header. This callback allows us to opt out of further
            processing if we know that request data is malformed based on header information.

            Added support for handling the 'Expect: 100-continue' header if sent by clients. ProtoHttpServ will always
            just send back the 100 status code and will not reject requests based on the expect header. If a payload is
            too large it can be rejected using the new header processing callback.

        ProtoAries
            Removed ProtoAries support.

        ProtoHttpUtil
            Added support for decoding url-encoded strings.

            Added support for parsing query parameters similar to what we use for parsing header information.

    DirtySDK (Android)
        Plat-Time
            Added Android implementation to ds_plattimetotime().

    DirtySDK (PS4)
        DirtySessionManagerPS4
            Added support for ps4 session changeable data.

            Added new server-driven mode (all operations that are executed from a server are now disabled, i.e.
            everything except what is necessary for invitation). DirtySessionManagerBinaryHeaderT and
            DirtySessionManagerChangeableBinaryHeaderT are now public (PS4 only). This is to enable a compile time
            check to ensure the Blaze Server’s structs are equivalent to those. C++ static assert are used in the
            Blaze client code (game manager) and they rely on those structures being public.

            Added new status selectors:
                'gcda' - to get the active session's changeable binary data size
                'gpcd' - to get the pending session's changeable binary data size
                'gagm' - to get the active changeable data game mode
                'gpgm' - to get the pending changeable data game mode
                'gagt' - to get the active binary data game type
                'gpgt' - to get the pending binary data game type
                'lsts' - to get the last status code returned from the calls to the Sony APIs

            Added new control selectors:
                'gchg' - to queue getting the changeable binary data into the pending session
                'serv' - to turn on server-driven session - in that mode, this client tech no longer honors any
                         client request for operations that are now owned by the server
                'sess' - to set session identifier (server-driven mode only)
                'spgm' - to set the pending session game mode
                'spgt' - to set the pending session game type

    DirtySDK (PS4/XboxOne)
        NetConn
            Added a new status selector 'eusr' which will return the IEAUser given a dirtysock user index.

        VoipHeadset
            Added new status selector 'sact' to determine if the shared device is active (Kinect/PS Camera).

Changes/fixes in this release:
    DirtySDK (All)
        Build
            Removed the AddDirtySDKLibsToModule task, external libraries are now added to the
            package.DirtySDK.dirtysock.libs.external fileset instead.

            Fixed 'NULL is defined to be 0' warning in platform.h by using #if defined instead of #ifdef.

            Removed the DIRTYCODE_API from typedefs, definitions do not need to be exported for dynamic libraries.

            Fixed an issue with how our C++ filesets are organized which caused files to be built both static and
            dynamic instead of based on the build configuration.

        NetGameDist
            Fixed NetGameDistInputQueryMulti() and NetGameDistInputCheck() to always poll NetGameDistUpdate() for
            new packet data if no remote inputs are available.  Previously, NetGameDistUpdate() would not be polled
            if there were no local input packets queued for sending, but this behavior had a negative impact in
            multi mode, requiring the caller poll NetGameDistUpdate() themselves if they had no inputs to send.  To
            fix that issue and simplify the code, the (minor) optimization of not calling NetGameDistUpdate() if no
            local input packets are queued, when in non-multi mode, was removed.

            Fixed NetGameDistInputQueryMulti() to be safer in the event the caller calling the function following a
            queue overrun.  In the event of a queue overrun it is possible to lose multi inputs that have a delta
            value that is not one (the default) assigned.  A delta greater than one that is lost will point the
            paired input queue pointer into unallocated buffer space, resulting in an invalid input with a length
            of zero.  This would result in a memcpy of -1 bytes which would result in a memory stomp and subsequent
            crash.  This scenario is now detected and handled safely; although the caller should still detect the
            overflow error and shut the game down, this condition will no longer cause a crash.

            Fixed NetGameDistInputCheck() to return "ready to receive" in multi mode if remote inputs are
            available, regardless of whether there are local inputs queued for sending or not.  This issue would
            cause titles calling NetGameDistInputCheck() to incorrectly not receive data that was available if they
            were not sending a steady stream of inputs themselves.

        ProtoHttpServ
            Changed to update the data that is based through the various callbacks for handling the request and
            responses.  Instead of using the same type, specific request and response types have been created.

            Changed the read/write callbacks to be receive/send to be clearer for integrators.

            Changed the request callback to allow to be called continuously if more processing time is needed based on
            the result.

            Changed the logging callback to no longer return a result.

        ProtoMangle
            Fixed a Valgrind warning by initializing a variable and preventing the possibility of copying garbage data
            to a buffer.

        ProtoTunnel
            Removed 1.0 protocol support and remaining Xbox 360 code.

            Removed ability to conditionally compile out HMAC.

            Fixed issue with _ProtoTunnelFindTunnel() not detecting a port change during handshake.

        Voip
            Removed Gen3 only parameter for VoipStartup().

            Changed the way we update voip channel settings. We now update it right when we get a ping and mic packet
            with the new channel information instead of in voip idle.  This also addresses potential multi-threading
            issue with applying channel configs.

        VoipCommon
            Fixed shared channel configs not being recalculated after a channel reset.

            Fixed a situation where channel configs are applied before we have any registered user.

        VoipConnection
            Fixed a wrong usage of ds_memcpy.

        VoipGroup
            Fixed an issue with mute flags being inconsistent or reset when player join both a game group and a game
            session.

            Fixed an issues with mute flag consistency across multiple voip groups when a user is a part of more than
            one at the same time.

            Fixed an issue where joining a second voip group or leaving an additional voip group would mute or unmute
            all players respectively.

            Changed 'umic' and 'uspk' control selectors to deprecated.

        WebOffer
            Changed the signature of WebOfferGetBusy2 to take the strDefaultMessage as a const char * instead of char *
            to prevent a writable strings warning on PS4.

    DirtySDK (PC)
        ProtoPingPC
            Fixed an issue on Windows XP where the ProtoPingIcmpResponseT structure was too small (the size required
            turns out to not be documented explicitly).  Adding a 32 byte buffer to the structure resolved the issue.

    DirtySDK (PS4)
        DirtyNetPS4
            Changed implementation such that socket receive thread now runs at high priority.

        DirtySessionManagerPS4
            Changed the dirtysessionmanger callback not to block when we have dirtywebapi queuing enabled.

        DirtyWebApiPS4
            Fixed a race condition where the webapi thread sometimes would miss the signal to wake up.

        NetConnPS4
            Removed internal automatic detection of system users by NetConn.  Usage of NetConnAddLocalUser() and
            NetConnRemoveLocalUser() is now mandatory. Implicit: Also removed 'cuis' and 'csiu' status selectors
            for converting system index into dirtysdk index (or opposite).

            Changed the method to determine what error state NetConn enters to more accurately reflect the reason we
            could not go online in a multiple user scenario.

        VoipPS4
            Changed implementation such that voip thread now runs at high priority.

        VoipHeadsetPS4
            Fixed initialization of voice lib thread priorities. sceVoiceStart() and sceVoiceCreatePort() are now
            being called from dedicated ephemeral high-priority threads to force internal Sony threads to also
            execute as high priority threads. This bug fix is required to eliminate crackling voice during heavy
            processing scenarios (game play).

            Changed voice lib initialization to comply with voice lib doc and to mimic what is done in Sony samples.

            Fixed _VoipHeadsetUpdateDecoderConnections() not being called when pHeadset->bSharedPrivilege changes.

            Changed implementation to flush the internal buffer of the decoder port when it is no longer connected to
            any speaker port. This is required to avoid "old voice" being played back when the decoder port is being
            reconnected to a speaker port.

    DirtySDK (Unix)
        DirtyNetUnix
            Fixed to prevent the logging of ENOTCONN errors when shutting down the socket to prevent unnecessary spam.

    DirtySDK (XboxOne)
        NetConnXboxOne
            Removed internal automatic detection of system users by NetConn.  Usage of NetConnAddLocalUser() and
            NetConnRemoveLocalUser() is now mandatory.  Implicit: Also removed 'cuis' and 'csiu' status selectors
            for converting system index into dirtysdk index (or opposite).

            Refactored NetConnXboxOne to reduced complexity.

        ProtoHttpXboxOne
            Refactored the status function to be consistent with other platforms. Certain selectors are only handled
            when the state of the module is ST_BODY or ST_DONE.

        ProtoMangleXboxOne
            Fixed _ProtoMangleRemoteHostAddRef() and _ProtoMangleRemoteHostDelRef() such that multi-threaded usage of
            refRemoteHostRefCountMap is now guarded by the critical section.

            Fixed implementation to now try-catch around usage of method used to compare two secure device addresses to
            gracefully handle rare cases where a COMException is thrown.

            Fixed implementation to now try-catch around SecureDeviceAddress::FromBytes().

        UserApiXboxOne
            Changed to using the AsyncOp refs to track the progress of requests. This prevents an issue where the
            previous bitfield might get stomped on in certain conditions and makes the code clearer to understand.

        VoipXboxOne
            Changed to move VoIP state destruction to NetConnIdle shutdown callback.  This move is because the VoIP
            thread can become blocked in Microsoft Chat code for over ten seconds in certain loss-of-network scenarios.
            This was causing long stalls when trying to VoipShutdown() upon loss of network.  Also added guard on
            VoipStartup() to ensure it is not called in a state where the module has not been shut down (VoipShutdown()
            already had the corresponding guard on the module having been started).

    *** Important - Gen3 platforms (PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360) no longer supported ***
    The Winter 1.0.x stability branch should be used for any further development on these platforms.

New in this release:
    DirtySDK (All)
        Build
            Removed Gen3 Support.

        ConnAPI
            Added support to gate the voip connection based on QoS validation. The 'estv' selector can be used to
            ungate the voip connection.

        ProtoHttp
            Added returning of http status code as part of the 'hres' status selector.

        ProtoSSL
            Added signature_algorithms hello extension support, enabled by default.  Some servers require this
            extension to be present before accepting a connection request.

            Added validation of supported signature algorithms upon receiving a CertificateRequest handshake message.

        XmlParse
            Added support for 64-bit integers via XmlContentGetInteger64 and XmlAttribGetInteger64.

    DirtySDK (PC)
        NetConnWin
             Added support querying for MAC address with valid IP using the 'ethr'/'macx' when non-zero is passed into
             iData.

    DirtySDK (PS4)
        DirtyNetPS4
            Added 'spam' selector support to change debug verbosity.

        NetConnPS4
            Added an error message for when PRX is not loaded for the sceNpAuthCreateAsyncRequest call.

        VoipHeadsetPS4
            Added support for the following bitrates: 14400, 16000 and 22533.  The default bitrate has been increased
            from 7300 to 16000.

Changes/fixes in this release:
    DirtySDK (All)
        Build
            Changed DirtySDK build scripts to use Framework Structured XML.

        DirtyCert
            Changed requesting certificates use format state field with "ST=" instead of "S=", which is the default
            OpenSSL nomenclature.

        NetConn
            Changed NetConnDisconnect() to also abort UPnP operations.

        ProtoHttp
            Changed default PUT/POST behavior to not reuse a previous connection (keep-alive).  When making a PUT or
            POST request and utilizing a keep-alive connection, it is possible for the server to close the connection
            and for that connection close to be "in flight" when issuing the request.  This results in the request
            being failed when the connection close is received.  Because a PUT or POST request can result in modifying
            server state, it may not be automatically re-issued.  Not using keep-alive avoids this complication.  A new
            ProtoHttpControl('rput') selector has been added to disable this behavior if the caller is willing to deal
            with this complication in trade for getting connection reuse on a PUT/POST.

        ProtoSSL
            Fixed incorrect CertificateVerify formatting when using TLS1.2.  This fixes client certificate support that
            was previously broken when connecting to a server supporting TLS1.2.

            Fixed an error with 'hres' selector not returning the right hresult in some cases.

        ProtoTunnel
            Fixed diagnostic output in _ProtoTunnelFindTunnel(), when re-matching addr/port, to include correct tunnel
            index instead of the max tunnel index.

    DirtySDK (PC/XboxOne)
        DirtyLibWin
            Fixed debug print on QueryPerformanceCounter() failure that was comparing against the wrong result code.

    DirtySDK (PS4)
        PrivilegeApiPS4
            Fixed a logical error that prevented a dialog from being appropriately terminated when aborted and the
            reference is not destroyed.

        DirtyWebApiPS4
            Fixed an issue where we were using the wrong critical section for handling errors which ended up in a
            deadlock if another request was made before the response was handled.

        DirtySessionManagerPS4
            Changed 'gses' control selector to now guard against passing in "INVALID".

        VoipHeadsetPS4
            Fixed the wrong user index being set when polling for voice.

    DirtySDK (PS4/XboxOne)
        NetConn
            Added ability to pass -1 into NetConnRemoveLocalUser(), in which case an internal lookup will be performed.

            Added a new selector 'iusr' than can be used to retrieve the index given the IEAUser UserId.

        VoipHeadset
            Fixed voipheadsetDeleteLocalUser() to also clear the last headset status.

            Fixed a situation where channel configs are applied before we have any registered user with voipheadset.

    DirtySDK (PS4/Unix)
        DirtyNet
            Fixed SocketConnect() to copy the remote address when performing an non-blocking connect
            (SCE_NET_EINPROGRESS/SYS_NET_EINPROGRESS/EINPROGRESS) for ps4/ps3/unix.

    DirtySDK (Unix)
        DirtyLibUnix
            Fixed NetTickUsec() to use proper scale for seconds.

    DirtySDK (XboxOne)
        NetConnXboxOne
            Changed the environment to be mapped to the sandbox ID. If it can't be mapped it will default back to TMS
            RETAIL -> PROD
            CERT -> CERT
            EARW.1 -> TEST

    *** Important - ProtoTunnel format modified - backward compatibility broken ***
    Th Winter 1.0 release of DirtySDK introduced a new ProtoTunnel protocol version - 1.1.  By default, this
    is the version used for all platforms except for Xbox 360.  ProtoTunnel v1.1 is not compatible with v1.0,
    and Xbox 360 is not compatible with v1.1.  Please make sure to rebuild any game servers in addition to
    game clients when upgrading to this release from a version older than Winter 1.0.

New in this release:
    DirtySDK (PS4)
        NetConnPS4
            Added NetConnRegisterNpStateCallback() to receive callbacks directly from NP State events.

Changes/fixes in this release:
    DirtySDK (All)
        NetGameLink
            Fixed a rare latency estimation issue at start of connection when local and remote clocks are close to but
            not quite synchronized.

    DirtySDK (PC)
        VoipPC
            Fixed VoipCommonUpdateRemoteStatus() not being invoked from the VoipThread.

            Fixed bPrivileged not defaulting to TRUE.

        VoipCommon
            Removed unnecessary PC specificities.

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        VoipHeadsetPS3
            Fixed implementation to no longer wait for the user to be in a participating state for acquiring and
            playing voice.  Without this change, there is some potential for garbled voice at connection establishment.

    DirtySDK (PS4)
        VoipHeadsetPS4
            Changed VoIP muting based on privileges back to be the most restrictive between local users. It will
            be reverted back to be muted on a per player basis once Sony provides us a way to check whether VoIP
            is being played back on the TV or headsets.

    DirtySDK (XboxOne)
        ConnApi
            Fixed _ConnApiInitClientConnectionState() to not reset ip address if it was already resolved (required for
            host migration to succeed with peer hosted topology when p2p voip is active before host migration).

        NetConnXBoxOne
            Fixed the value of the internet connectivity state to reset after a resume to prevent the user from getting
            stuck in an offline state after a NetConnDisconnect()/NetConnConnect().

        UserListApiXBoxOne
            Fixed the queueing of UserListApiIsFriendAsync() requests which return success codes but then behaved
            strangely when more than one request was active.

            Fixed a possible memory leak on shutdown.

    DirtySDK (PC/PS3/Unix/XboxOne)
        DirtyLib
            Fixed a rare thread safety issue in SocketLookup around
            refcounting

    *** Important - Please update your QOS servers from your Blaze server configurations ***
    The changes to the qosapi requires the new version of the QOS servers in order to function properly.
    Contact GOSOPS for information about the most up to date QOS servers.

    *** Important - ProtoTunnel format modified - backward compatibility broken ***
    This release of DirtySDK introduces a new ProtoTunnel protocol version - 1.1.  By default, this is the
    version used for all platforms except for Xbox 360.  ProtoTunnel v1.1 is not compatible with v1.0, and
    Xbox 360 is not compatible with v1.1.  Please make sure to rebuild any game servers in addition to game
    clients when upgrading to this release.

New in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        ProtoTunnel
            Added support for the new 1.1 version of the ProtoTunnel protocol, with the following features:
                - Introduces backwards compatibility for future protocol versions.
                - Control packet data data used in handshaking is still authenticated, but is now unencrypted.
                - Adds fast matching (and re-matching, when the source addr and/or port changes) of packet data to the
                  correct endpoint.
                - Version 1.0 can still be selected and is the default for Xbox 360 operation.  Xbox 360 is not
                  compatible with 1.1 or later versions of the protocol.
                - Version 1.0 is compatible with the previous ProtoTunnel protocol.

        CommUDP
            Added a packet received flag which can be accessed through NetGameUtilStatus('pkrc'). The flag is stored in
            ConnApiClientT GameInfo.uConnFlags. This part of the more specific join error task GOSREQ-184.

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        NetConnPS3
            Added 'nper' selector to NetConnStatus() to allow the user to differentiate a user logging out from PSN
            from PSN disconnect.

    DirtySDK (XboxOne)
        NetConnXboxOne
            Added a critical section to protect against NetConnStatus('xusr') being called from the voip thread.

        VoipHeadsetXboxOne
            Added support for MS voip bystanders (cert requirement).

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        ConnApiXenon
            Added ConnApiControl('xonl') which can be used to tell ConnApiXenon to no longer attempt game connectivity
            but to only perform Xsession management.

            Added _ConnApiMoveToNextState() for improved logging of ConnApiXenon state transitions.

Changes/fixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        CryptRSA
            Refactored to make modular exponentiation an iterative process.  This allows it to be spread out over
            multiple updates, which is useful as the operation can take significant amounts of clock time and is
            blocking.  As part of this change, roughly 12k of temporary state that used to be on the stack is now
            moved to the RSA state.

            Switched to use 64-bit math on Linux and PS4, improving execution time on those platforms.

        DirtyCert
            Switched to new gosca.ea.com endpoint using certificate issued against GOS2015 CA.

        DirtySessionManager
            Renamed DirtySessionManagerComplete() to DirtySessionManagerGetSecureIp(), and made that new function
            xenon-only.

        NetConn
            Changed UPnP initialization: if peerport netconn param is not specified, netconn now configures
            protoupnp with default port 3659 instead of default port 0.

        NetGameDist
            Fixed _strNetGameDistDataType to also cover GMDIST_DATA_NODATA.

        ProtoHttp
            Changes to harden protohttp against multi-threaded calls into update, send, and recv functions from
            interfering with one another.

        ProtoSSL
            Enabled ServerName Hello Extension by default.

            Refactored to take advantage of iteratve modular exponentation for SendClientKeyExchange and
            SendCertificateVerify operations.

            Switched CA provider flag from GOS2013 CA to GOS2015 CA.  This allows the new DirtyCert endpoint to
            provision CA certificates.

        QosApi
            Refactored qosapi to improve maintainability, this is extensive changes throughout the
            implementation.

            Changed qosapi so that the different phases of the qos process (latency, bandwidth, firewall)
            do not have dependencies on one another.  In the past firewall could only be done after
            bandwidth, and qos phases would have an impact on the error status of other qos phases.

            Changed qosapi to use the new ip reported by the server rather than the IP address discovered
            by the DNS lookup. The old behavior prevented XBox One from successfully querying the NAT type,
            due to DNS round robin issues.

            Removed the client to client methods QosApiListen() and QosApiRequest() from the qosapi.

        VoipConnection
            Fixed incorrect array size for LocalUsers

    DirtySDK (PS3)
        DirtyNetPS3
            Fixed a race condition that causes memory corruption when calling NetConnShutdown() while a
            hostname lookup is in progress.  NetConnShutdown() now waits until all hostname threads are
            finished.

    DirtySDK (PS4)
        DirtySessionManagerPS4
            Removed DirtySessionManagerComplete().

    DirtySDK (XboxOne)
        NetConnXboxOne
            Fixed a case where the connectivity level can be stuck because of a missing notification from
            Microsoft. When logging out after a resume event it seems that we sometimes do not receive an
            XBoxLiveAccess notification when logging back in after the resume. This fix forces a check of
            the network state after 5 seconds.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        ConnApiXenon
            Changed implementation to guarantee that _ConnApiUpdateDemangle() will never be performed before
            XSessionCreate() or XSesssionMigrateHost() completes (on both session host and session members).
            Failure to enforce such a serialization can lead to 2 potential problems:  secure address being
            resolved with an invalid session id (if primary session creation is not complete) or connapi
            exiting ST_MIGRATE state prematurely before firing SESSEVENT (if secondary session migration is
            not complete).

            Changed ConnApiUpdate() such that _ConnApiUpdateDemangle() cannot be called when a session
            creation or a session migration is pending.

            Removed usage of ConnApiSessionManagerStatus('idle') at the beginning of _ConnApiUpdateDemangle():
            no longer required now that calls to _ConnApiUpdateDemangle() from ConnApiUpdate() are limited to
            states where it is allowed.

            Fixed _ConnApiInitClientList() to properly initialize pConnApi->GameServer.ClientInfo.strTunnelKey
            (inspired from connapi.c) This fix is minor because the tunnel key is not used on xenon anyway.

        ConnApiXenonSessionManager
            Enhanced implementation of ConnApiXenonSessionManagerComplete() to make it clear that
            ConnApiXenonSessionManagerGetSecureIp() CANNOT return "in-progress".

            Fixed implementation of ConnApiXenonSessionManagerComplete() to return the right secure ip address for the
            console specified as input. It used to return pRef->iAddrPrimary which is not guaranteed to match the
            specified console.

            Renamed ConnApiXenonSessionManagerComplete() to ConnApiXenonSessionManagerGetSecureIp()

            Removed ConnApiXenonSessionManagerControl('conn') which was dead code because the 'conn' selector is no
            longer supported in DirtySessionManager.

        DirtySessionManagerXenon
            Renamed DirtySessionManagerComplete() to DirtySessionManagerGetSecureIp().

        VoipXenon
            Fixed implementation of VoipSetLocalUser() to properly setup the VoipUserT to be passed to
            _VoipRegisterLocalTalker(). Without this fix, wrong xuids are registered with XHV resulting
             in calls to  pXHVEngine->SubmitIncomingChatData() intermittently failing with ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION.

        ConnApi
            Fixed a bug where ConnApi will tried to initialize clients with NULL machine address.

        DirtyMem
            Fixed to export DirtyMemAlloc and DirtyMemFree when building as a DLL.

            Added include of <stdlib.h> to prevent malloc() and free() calls for default memory allocators compiling
            out when building as a DLL.

            through.

        ProtoHttp
            Fixed a memory pointer issue when sending chunked http transaction faster than the network can keep up
            that could lead to potentially sending parts of uninitialized memory over the network.

            Changed to check status of open keep-alive connection in the DONE state, to detect server-closed
            connections when they are closed, rather than waiting until the ProtoHttp ref is used in a new transaction
            or destroyed.

        VoipConnection
            Fixed an integration error. VoipConnectionStartup() will now have a max player check. If for any reason
            voip system is not started properly voip setup will be skipped by Blaze.

        DirtyLib
            Fixed wrong critical section length for iOS64.

    DirtySDK (PS4)
        DirtyWebApiPS4
            Changed priority and scheduling setting of internal threads in favor of less aggressive threading
            patterns to avoid negatively impacting game with unnecessary thread switches during game play.

        NetConnPS4
            Fixed an error which prevents users from going online if PSN does not respond quickly to the parental
            settings query.

        PrivilegeApiPS4
            Fixed an integration error, which caused _PrivilegeApiUpdateDialogStatus callback not to be removed properly.

    DirtySDK (XboxOne)
        ProtoMangleXboxOne
            Fixed a potential crash if a client is removed and re-added while corresponding security association
            creation is in progress.

        DirtySDK 2015 Winter Upgrade available here:
        https://docs.developer.ea.com/display/dirtysock/DirtySDK+2015+Winter+Upgrade+Guide

New in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        ProtoSSL
            Added support for AES-128-GCM-SHA256 and AES-256-GCM-SHA384 cipher suites.

            Added two obsolete alternate definitions for sha1withRSAEncryption for compatibility with some software
            that generates certificates using these object IDs, for example makecert.exe in WindowsSDK.

        ProtoTunnel
            Enhanced debug logging for the 'bnds' selector.

        Voip
            Enhanced API for user registration to better support MLU (Multiple Local Users) scenarios. Every local user
            should now be registered with the voip sub-system using VoipSetLocalUser() in order for its headset status
            info to be available for queries. To additionally get fully functional voip, local users must be further
            activated with VoipActivateLocalUser(), which promotes the user to a "participating" state. Basically any
            user being pulled into the game should be a participating user. Associated public api impact:
                * New synopsis for VoipSetLocalUser()
                * New function to promote local users to "participating" state: VoipActivateLocalUser()

        VoipGroup
            Enhanced VoipGroup api. It was re-aligned with changes to the voip api called out above.
                * New function to promote local users to "participating" state: VoipGroupActivateLocalUser()

    DirtySDK (PC)
        DirtyErrPC
            Added DirtyErrPC implementation with pc-specific errors.

        ProtoPingPC
            Added a new version of protoping for PC, using ICMPSendEcho2() API.  This API allows use of ICMP when an
            application is run without administrator privilege, which is required for use of RAW sockets employed with
            protoping.c.

    DirtySDK (PS4)
        VoipHeadsetPS4
            Enhanced _VoipHeadsetIsLocalVoiceFrameReady() to detect voice readiness quicker.

            Added '-pbk' and '+pbk' selectors to better support our voip channel feature under MLU scenarios.

    DirtySDK (WinRT/WintPRT)
        DirtyLibWinRT
            Enhanced NetPrintfCode() to use OutputDebugStringA() instead of OutputDebugStringW().

    DirtySDK (XboxOne)
        UserApiXboxOne
            Added support for the 'avsz' selector. Now different profile pictures sizes can be fetched.

        VoipXboxOne
            Added selectors:
            VoipStatus 'pcac' - returns true if party chat is active
            VoipStatus 'pcsu' - returns true if party chat is currently suspended
            VoipControl 'pcsu' - takes iValue as a bool, TRUE suspend party chat, FALSE resume it
            In order for VoipControl 'pcsu' to work you must add to the appxmanifest.xml:
            <mx:Extension Category="xbox.multiplayer">
                <mx:XboxMultiplayer CanSuppressPartyChat="true" />
            </mx:Extension>

Changes/fixes in this release:

    DirtySDK (All)
        General
            Replaced APIs deprecated by Microsoft with generic equivalents.

        ConnApi
            Changed synopsis of ConnApiOnline(): it no longer has a pSelfAddr parameter.

            Changed ConnApiUserInfoT.uClientFlags to ConnApiUserInfoT.uFlags.

            Changed ConnApiClientInfoT.uMachineId to ConnApiCLientInfoT.uId.

            Removed multiple virtual machine mode: connapi 'mvtm' status and control selectors no longer exist.
            The implementation is now multiple-virtual-machine capable by default.

            Removed ConnApiUserInfoT, ConnApiAddUser() and ConnApiRemoveUser() for all platforms except xbox360.

            Removed ConnApiFindClient(), then renamed ConnApiFindClientById() to ConnApiFindClient().

            Removed ConnApiClientInfoT.strUniqueId

            Removed _ConnApiDefaultCallback() and made the debug logging client-centric instead of user-centric.

        DirtyNet
            Changed all dirtynet files to log unsupported status selectors the same way.

        NetGameLink
            Changed implementation to avoid code duplication: moved packet loss calculation logics into a static
            function.

            Changed the names of several member variables in the NetGameLinkStatT structure. The changes are listed below:
            bps  to outbps
            rps  to outrps
            nps  to outnps
            pps  to outpps
            rpps to outrpps

        ProtoSSL
            Changed to request TLS1.2 instead of TLS1.1.  Servers are still allowed to select any version from TLS1.2
            down to SSLv3.

            Changed to use 64-bit time for certificate expiration checking, so certificates created with expiration
            times far in the future won't fail validation.

            Changed to harden protossl against multi-threaded use causing obscure secure failures.

        VoipConnection
            Removed platform specificities in _VoipConnectionInit().

        VoipPacket
            Changed value of VOIP_PACKET_STATUS_FLAG_METADATA from 2 to 1.

    DirtySDK (PS4)
        DirtyWebApiPS4
            Removed DirtyWebApiCreate()/DirtyWebApiCreateEx() and renamed DirtyWebApiCreateEx2() to
            DirtyWebApiCreate().

            Changed WebApi threads to only wakeup when there are jobs queued.

        VoipHeadsetPS4
            Fixed establishment of connections between a decoder port and all local speaker ports when a user is added
            after a decoder was created.

    DirtySDK (XboxOne)
        DirtyNetXboxOne
            Fixed _SocketAddrMapGet() to no longer include the port value when trying to match an input ipv6 address
            with an existing mapping. This change is required for multi-hub test bench to be functional on xboxone:
            because hubs all bind to different game port, the inbound traffic source port may not be same as the ipv6
            address mapped when resolving secure device address for the local console.

        VoipHeadsetXboxOne
            Deprecated support for pre-March2014 XDKs (_XDK_VER < 10698).

            Replaced VOIPHEADSET_VOICELIB_DEBUG with VOIPHEADSET_DEBUG.

    DirtySDK (Xenon)
        ConnnApiXenon
            Changed internal usage of some control selectors: moved call to ConnApiXenonManagerControl('self')
            and VoipGroupControl('lusr') from ConnApiOnline() to _ConnApiInitClientList()

            Fixed connapixenon to properly update the remote tunnel port with the peer's internally bound port
            when the internal address (i.e. internal to NAT scope) is used to reach that peer.

            Fixed a logical error forcing the voip connection attempt to fail early.
