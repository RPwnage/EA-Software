This directory contains files for a hypothetical patch, though in this particular case there 
are no actual files that are part of the patch. It is the directory image of the patch 
that will be generated. Some files, including this one, are intentionally set to be ignored so 
that we can verify that the ignore feature of the PatchMaker works as intended. A peer to this
directory is a directory called "Patch 1 original". That directory is a directory which is intended
to act like the original data, before the patch is applied. The contents of that directory are
typically somewhat similar to the contents of this directory, as it represents the original
shipping image of the directory, while this directory represents the newly patched image.
