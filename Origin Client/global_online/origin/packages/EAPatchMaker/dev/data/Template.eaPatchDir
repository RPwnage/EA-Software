# This is a text file which simply lists URLs for available patches.
# The application may examine the list of patches and further reduce the 
# set of available patches based on information within the patch info file.
# In the example below, there is a separate directory for each .eapatchInfo
# file, but all .eaPatchInfo files could be in the same directory. However,
# the patch implementations themselves (.eaPatchImpl, etc.) still would 
# need to be in separate directories. The names of the .eaPatchInfo files
# are arbitrary and don't have to be the same as the directory they are 
# in, though it's easiest to understand if that's so and the .eaPatchImpl
# files are also named the same.
#
# Both absolute and relative URLs are supported. In the case of relative URLs
# the system assumes that the http://<server>/ part is just the same as whatever 
# server the .eaPatchDir came from.
# 
# Paths are expected to be in a form compatible with paths used as HTML links,
# which means, for example, that special characters need to be escaped, etc.
