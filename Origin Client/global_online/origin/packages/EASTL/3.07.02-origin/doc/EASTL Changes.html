<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fully qualifying call to move in algorithms "remove_copy_if".</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Version 3.07.02</strong> (Jan 17, 2018)</p>

<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Added SSO or the "short string optimization" support in eastl::string.</li>

<p><strong>Version 3.05.08</strong> (Aug 14, 2017)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Adding natvis visualizer for eastl::ring_buffer.</li>
	<li>Updated natvis visualizer for eastl::string and eastl::vector.</li>
	<li>Improved eastl::vector by guarding against user types with overloaded address-of operators. This was observed in "eastl::vector<ComPtr<T>>" usage.</li>

	<li>Removing eastl::any type checking when RTTI is disabled due to cross dll pointer issues.</li>
	<li>Relaxing restrictions on what the type of the find_by_hash' input parameter can be. Instead of a requirement of a specific type, any type convertible to the underlying type is acceptable.</li> 
</ul>


<p><strong>Version 3.05.06</strong> (Jun 05, 2017)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Resolved shared_ptr conversion operator= with no return expression.</li>
	<li>Corrected constructor of ref_count_sp to match parameter types of the declaration.</li>
	<li>Removing comments suggesting auto_ptr converstion methods as auto_ptr has been deprecated and removed from the standard.</li>
	<li>Resolved VS2017 Preview 1 compiler warnings.</li>
	<li>Disabled single-argument eastl::pair move-constructor (only GCC due to a bug) that generates an error for lvalue and rvalue overloads.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Version 3.05.05</strong> (May 08, 2017)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>

	<li>Fixed move_iterator operator++(int) / operator--(int) not incrementing its state.</li>
	<li>Implemented fixed_ring_buffer template alias to simplify the creation of ring_buffers backed by fixed_sized containers.</li>
	<li>Added templates aliases for new hashtable based container names. (eg. unordered_set and unordered_map)</li>
	<li>Improved internal hashtable support for move-only (aka. non-copyable types).</li>
	<li>string_view fixes:
		<ul>
			<li>implemented cbegin/rbegin/crbegin fixes and unit tests</li>
			<li>implemented cend/rend/crend fixes and unit tests</li>
			<li>Added CharTypeStringRSearch function to char_traits header and fixed unit tests to called string_view::rfrind.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 3.05.01</strong> (Jan 10, 2017)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Resolving issue of eastl_size_t causing mismatch problems with standard C library functions like 'strlen'</li>
	<li>Resolved vector_map/vector_multimap::count to be called from const contexts.</li>
	<li>Resolving eastl::is_function returning incorrect results for Microsoft specific calling conventions (eg. __stdcall).</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Version 3.05.00</strong> (December 7, 2016)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Implemented eastl:string_view, a non-owning string type that isn't templated on an allocator making it suitable for use at API boundaries.
		<ul><li>http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>Adding support for typed get for tuple (e.g. get<typename T>(tuple<Ts...>& t)).</li>
	<li>CoreAllocatorAdapter::operator= now copies the allocator name.</li>
	<li>Fixed strict-aliasing issues in the eastl::intrusive_list implementation.</li>
	<li>Adding move semantic guards around test code requiring that language feature.</li>
	<li>Improving eastl::vector implementation to move elements (instead of copying) during a resize.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Version 3.04.01</strong> (Oct 26, 2016)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
	<li>eastl::function the size of the local buffers that hold captures and allocators can tuned via the EASTL_FUNCTION_DEFAULT_CAPTURE_SSO_SIZE, and EASTL_FUNCTION_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR_SSO_SIZE defines.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 3.04.00</strong> (Oct 21, 2016)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Implemented eastl::any, a type-safe container for single values of any type that is implemented with the 'local buffer optimization' to avoid heap allocations for small objects.</li>
	<li>Improving standards conformance of vector::swap and improves use of vector with non-copyable or move-only types (e.g. unique_ptr). This includes a subtle but important behaviour change were vector::swap will no longer perform a copy of the vectors elements when the allocator instances are different. If you rely on copying elements from one vector to another when calling vector::swap(), you can reintroduce the slower, standard non-conforming behaviour by building with 'EASTL_VECTOR_LEGACY_SWAP_BEHAVIOUR_REQUIRES_COPY_CTOR' as a global define.</li>
	<li>Implemented hashtable::reserve(element_count). This rehashes the underlying hashtable of all the hash containers to the accomdate the element count without exceeding the max load factor.
		<ul><li>http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map/reserve</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>Changed chrono::GetTicks() implementation on PS4 to rely on sceKernelGetProcessTimeCounter() rather than sceKernelReadTsc() as the former is unaffected by process suspend events.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Version 3.03.00</strong> (Sept 2, 2016)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Implemented eastl::is_swappable_with / eastl::is_nothrow_swappable_with.</li>
	<li>Implemented eastl::clamp.</li>
	<li>Brought back new classes from Frostbite:
		<ul>
			<li>segmented_vector: vector that does not invalid iterators/references when elements are added.</li>
			<li>string_map: specialized version of a map that uses a const char* as the key.</li>
			<li>string_hash_map: specialized version of a hash_map that uses a const char* as the key.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Added the capability to specify an extra source file to be compiled with the package. This is required for Frostbite's Arena Allocator.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Version 3.02.00</strong> (July 8, 2016)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Implemented eastl::optional<T>. For more details see: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional.
	<li>Implemented 'transparent operator functors' for the following:
		<ul>
			<li>plus</li>
			<li>minus</li>
			<li>multiplies</li>
			<li>divides</li>
			<li>modulus</li>
			<li>negate</li>
			<li>equal_to</li>
			<li>not_equal_to</li>
			<li>greater</li>
			<li>less</li>
			<li>greater_equal</li>
			<li>less_equal</li>
			<li>logical_and</li>
			<li>logical_or</li>
			<li>logical_not</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Implemented eastl::void_t.</li>
	<li>Implemented eastl::is_same_v.</li>
	<li>Implemented eastl::reverse(Iterator) to support reverse iteration in ranged-based for-loops.</li>
	<li>Added allocation failure asserts to containers that do not utilize local storage.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 3.01.01</strong> (May 19, 2016)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Implemented eastl::bool_constant.</li>
	<li>Implemented eastl::fixed_hash_map::rehash now supports hashtable bucket array overflow.</li>
	<li>Implemented non-member eastl::size/eastl::data/eastl::empty.</li>
	<li>Removed internal eastl::empty<T> structure due to name collision.</li>
</ul>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 3.01.00</strong> (Apr 15, 2016)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Added the ability to override EASTL_DEBUG_BREAK so that it no longer points to an external function call. This is useful for when the user simply wants to disable EASTL_DEBUG_BREAK and doesn't want to define a custom external function, or it simply isn't possible with their build setup. To override the EASTL_DEBUG_BREAK, user must define the globalproperty EASTL.EASTL_DEBUG_BREAK_OVERRIDE=(new macro definition)</li>
	<li>Implemented eastl::to_string/eastl::to_wstring.</li>
	<li>Implemented eastl::exchange.</li>
	<li>Implemented eastl::as_const.</li>

	<li>Fixed eastl::mem_fn usage for compilers that support variadic templates.</li>
    <li>Added EASTL.natvis to Visual Studio solutions.  VS2015 will automatically parse NATVIS files included in your solution removing the requirement to manually install NATVIS files.</li>
	<li>Added runtime asserts in eastl::list that validates the containers allocator returns a non-null address.</li>
</ul>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 2.10.04</strong> (September 23, 2015)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
	<li>eastl::function fixes for MSVC allocating memory due to known issue with is_nothrow_move_constructible.</li>
	<li>eastl::function fixes for stateful allocators trashing the locally stored functor object.</li>
	<li>Converted initialize.xml to structured-XML which fixes warnings generated by Framework.</li>
	<li>Fixing signed/unsigned mismatch compiler error on capilano when using eastl::deque.</li>
	<li>Fix function_table copy assignment being deleted due to constant data members (function pointers).</li>
	<li>Required licensing changes.</li>
	<li>Fixing VS2015 warnings.</li>
</ul>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 2.10.03</strong> (July 3, 2015)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>

	<li>Fixed fixed_pool allocate call to use provided alignment parameters.</li>
</ul>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 2.10.02</strong> (June 3, 2015)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed eastl::hash_set insert creating template instantiations for types that are not convertible to the eastl::hash_set value_type.</li>
	<li>Added C++11 bitset::all().</li>
	<li>Disabled warning C4746 on EASTL usage of __is_pod on Microsoft platforms.</li>
</ul>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 2.10.01</strong> (May 11, 2015)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an eastl::ring_buffer bug when using iterator subtraction to insert data.</li>
</ul>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 2.09.01</strong> (March 16, 2015)</p>

		<li>Noexcept operator bugs with variadic template expansions</li>
		<li>Fixes for functions called with parameters with declspec alignment qualifiers</li>
		<li>Enabled "pair(pair&&) = default" consructor for VS2015+ builds</li>
	</ul>
    <li>Added a compile-time assert for use of find_by_hash when hash codes are not cached.  find_by_hash is an optimization designed to take advantage of the hash being available, so it does not recalculate hashes.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug with alignment in fixed size containers that can overflow.</li>
    <li>Fix for alignment error when the key has greater alignment requirements than the value, in the fixed_hash_map.</li>
	<li>Fix for allocation alignment limitation in DLL builds.</li>
	<li>Fix for shrink_to_fit where move semantics are not available.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 2.09.00</strong> (October, 2014)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added a safer version of <span class="code">find_by_hash</span>, which takes in the key as well as the hash, in order to be sure we are finding the right one.</li>
  <li>Added a <span class="code">clear</span> method to <span class="code">fixed_vector</span>, which can free the overflow memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed some bugs in container classes that were being overly restrictive about what types they could contain.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in <span class="code">list::emplace()</span> - it should return an iterator to the newly inserted element, not the same pos iterator that was passed in.</li>
  <li>Fixed an integer overflow bug in <span class="code">basic_string::find()</span>.
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 2.08.00</strong> (September, 2014)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implmented atomic increment, decrement, and compare-and-swap for versions of GCC used by CentOS.</li>
  <li>Added a public version.h header.</li>
  <li>Resolved compilation warnings in iphone-arm64 configurations.</li>
  <li>Modified the type of <span class="code">hash_code_t</span> in <span class="code">hash_code_base</span> to match the return type of the <span class="code">hash&lt;T&gt;</span> function to avoid warnings.  Similarly, the <span class="code">mod_range_hashing</span> operator was modified to accept a <span class="code">size_t</span> as its first argument.</li>
  <li>Resolved compilation problem when compiling with PS3SDK 460.001.</li>
  <li>Implemented a default EASTLCoreDeleter implementation. Introduced a dependency on coreallocator inorder to test the functionality that relays on icoreallocator interfaces.</li>
  <li>Implemented a default EASTLCoreAllocator implementation.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 2.07.00</strong> (June, 2014)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li> Changed the list::sort implementation to avoid creating temporary lists. This fixes a problem with fixed_list::sort whereby it was previously using its own implementation which effectively invalidated iterators. The fixed_list problem was reported by Henrik Karlsson.</li>
  <li>Added the following functions:<br>
    <br>
    <span class="code"> // We provide a version of insert which lets the caller directly specify the hash value and <br>
       // a potential node to insert if needed. This allows for less thread contention in the case<br>
       // of a thread-shared hash table that's accessed during a mutex lock, because the hash calculation<br>
       // and node creation is done outside of the lock. If pNodeNew is supplied by the user (i.e. non-NULL) <br>
       // then it must be freeable via the hash table's allocator. If the return value is true then this function <br>
       // took over ownership of pNodeNew, else pNodeNew is still owned by the caller to free or to pass <br>
       // to another call to insert. pNodeNew need not be assigned the value by the caller, as the insert<br>
       // function will assign value to pNodeNew upon insertion into the hash table. pNodeNew may be <br>
// created by the user with the allocate_uninitialized_node function, and freed by the free_uninitialized_node function.<br>
template &lt;class P&gt;<br>
    insert_return_type insert(hash_code_t c, node_type* pNodeNew, P&amp;&amp; otherValue);<br>
    insert_return_type insert(hash_code_t c, node_type* pNodeNew, const value_type&amp; value); <br>
    <br>
  // Used to allocate and free memory used by insert(const value_type&amp; value, hash_code_t c, node_type* pNodeNew).<br>
node_type* allocate_uninitialized_node();<br>
void free_uninitialized_node(node_type* pNode);</span> </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 2.06.00</strong> (May 12th, 2014)</p>
<p>Release notes </p>
<ul>
  <li>The new conforming version of <span class="code">shared_ptr</span> in this release may possibly break some existing uses. There are only a couple possible relevant changes that could break users, and they are probably easily worked around. The breaks would be at compile-time, not run-time.</li>
  <li>There is an outstanding issue with Visual Studio 2013's compiler when using std::initializer_list types in operator=(). https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/792355/compiler-confused-about-whether-to-use-a-initializer-list-assignment-operator </li>
  <li>Visual Studio 2013's compiler will throw warnings when passing aligned structs as value which can occur when use eastl::is_trivial&lt;T&gt;. To circumvent this temporarily, aligned structs beyond stack pointer alignment will be declared as non-trivial. </li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li> Fixed a compile failure with<span class="code"> make_pair(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;abcd&quot;)</span> under VC++ (two string literals of different lengths).</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the rbtree (map, multimap, set, multiset) move constructor which would result in a subsequent crash. </li>
  <li>Changed two <span class="code">vector::erase</span> calls from <span class="code">eastl::copy</span> to <span class="code">eastl::move</span>, which can sigificantly improve performance for movable types. This was missed during the update of vector to support C++11 move. </li>
  <li>Implemented a conforming C++11 <span class="code">unique_ptr</span>, <span class="code">shared_ptr</span>, <span class="code">weak_ptr</span>. This includes thread-safety as specified by the C++11 Standard. </li>
  <li><span class="code">shared_array</span> has been updated to be more consistent with the new <span class="code">shared_ptr</span>. However, in the future <span class="code">shared_array</span> will likely be deprecated and the functionality handled by <span class="code">shared_ptr</span>.</li>
  <li>Fixed a case where bitset::to_ulong was not throwing a <span class="code">std::overflow_error</span> exception when it should have been, only if EASTL exception support is enabled. </li>
  <li>Added <span class="code">move_if_noexcept</span> support to containers. This allows them to handle move vs. copy properly for when EASTL exception support is enabled. </li>
  <li>Fixed <span class="code">make_move_if_noexcept_iterator</span> to work with compilers that have weak C++11 support (e.g. VS2012 and earlier). </li>
  <li>Added C++11 <span class="code">allocator_arg_t</span> and C++14 <span class="code">allocator_arg</span> to &lt;memory.h&gt;. </li>

<p><strong>Version 2.05.00</strong> (April, 2014)</p>
<p>Release notes</p>
<ul>
  <li> A class privacy change was made which shouldn't affect users unless they have custom containers that inherit directly from the internal <span class="code">hashtable</span> and <span class="code">rbtree</span> classes. </li>
  <li> This release completes the support for C++11 container const_iterators,  rvalue move, and emplace. </li>
  <li>Most container usage has the capability of being faster now under C++11 compilers due to move functionality. There's an uncommon case (classes that are slow to copy) where move-related emplace functionality can possibly be slower than the corresponding insert for some container types, but this will be addressed in a future release. </li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented VC++ <span class="code">make_pair</span> workaround for the case of calling <span class="code">make_pair(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)</span>.
    <ul>
      <li>This problem was introduced in EASTL 2.02.00 with its C++11 <span class="code">pair</span> support. Reported by Christopher Vienneau.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in some containers'<span class="code"> operator=</span> for the case of <span class="small">EASTL_ALLOCATOR_COPY_ENABLED</span> which could have caused a crash when allocators were unequal.
    <ul>
      <li>It's unlikely users would have seen this bug manifested because it requires assignment between containers of unequal allocators, because people rarely (if ever) do this.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed some C++ exception handling support which got stale from disuse over the last few years of changes.
      <ul>
        <li>Full conformance of behavior in the presence of arbitrary exceptions hasn't been well-validated, though if you need this done let the package maintainers know.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a potential crash bug in the string class when assigned to another string via the move constructor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changes for <span class="code">list</span>, <span class="code">fixed_list</span>, <span class="code">slist</span>, <span class="code">fixed_slist</span>:
    <ul>
      <li>C++11 rvalue move support.</li>
        <li>Added <span class="code">const_iterator</span> arguments (C++11 changed <span class="code">insert(iterator, ...)</span> to <span class="code">insert(const_iterator, ...)</span>. </li>
        <li>C++11 emplace support (<span class="code">emplace</span>, <span class="code">emplace_back</span>, <span class="code">emplace_front</span>). You can use emplace with compilers that don't support variadiac template arguments, but can you use only single value_type arguments. </li>
        <li>C++11 noexcept for all appropriate functions.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug in <span class="code">list</span> and <span class="code">slist</span> <span class="code">operator=</span> for the case of <span class="small">EASTL_ALLOCATOR_COPY_ENABLED</span> which could have caused a crash when allocators were unequal. </li>
        <li>Fixed <span class="code">list::splice</span> and <span class="code">slist::splice</span> so it can handle containers with unqual allocators.
            <ul>
              <li>This change allows <span class="code">slist::splice</span> to work and allows splicing between <span class="code">list</span> and <span class="code">fixed_list</span>, <span class="code">slist</span> and <span class="code">fixed_slist</span>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="code">slist</span> (the analogue of C++11 <span class="code">forward_list</span>) now supports all C++11 functionality except the <span class="code">merge</span>.</li>
        <li>Deprecated container-less <span class="code">slist</span> <span class="code">splice</span> functions,  as they don't allow for recognizing the allocator, cannot maintain the source mSize, and are not in the C++11 Standard definition of <span class="code">std::forward_list</span>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changes for <span class="code">ring_buffer:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Added C++11 rvalue move ctor and assigment support.</li>
      <li>Added C++11 <span class="code">const_iterator</span> support.</li>
      <li><span class="code">ring_buffer</span> is still missing C++11 element rvalue insertion and emplace and support.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changes for <span class="code">vector</span>, <span class="code">fixed_vector</span>:
    <ul>
      <li>Improved <span class="code">fixed_vector::set_capacity</span> to use move operations when possible.</li>
      <li> Added C++11 rvalue move support for <span class="code">insert</span>, <span class="code">push_back</span>, <span class="code">push_front</span>, and added <span class="code">emplace</span> support.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug in<span class="code"> operator=</span> for the case of <span class="small">EASTL_ALLOCATOR_COPY_ENABLED</span> which could have caused a crash when allocators were unequal. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <li>Added C++11 rvalue move ctor and assigment support.</li>
    <li>Added C++11 <span class="code">const_iterator</span> support.</li>
    <li>Added C++11 rvalue move support for <span class="code">insert</span>, <span class="code">push_back</span>, <span class="code">push_front</span>, and added <span class="code">emplace</span> support.</li>
    <li>Added <span class="code">shrink_to_fit</span>, and implemented <span class="code">set_capacity</span>, which was previously a no-op.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in<span class="code"> operator=</span> for the case of <span class="small">EASTL_ALLOCATOR_COPY_ENABLED</span> which could have caused a crash when allocators were unequal. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Changes for tree containers (<span class="code">set</span>, <span class="code">map</span>, <span class="code">fixed_set</span>, <span class="code">vector_set</span>, etc):
    <ul>
      <li>Added C++11 rvalue move ctor and assigment support.</li>
      <li>Added C++11 <span class="code">const_iterator</span> support.</li>
      <li>Added C++11 rvalue move support for <span class="code">insert</span>,  and added <span class="code">emplace</span> and <span class="code">emplace_hint</span> support.</li>
      <li>Added support for the C++11 <span class="code">value_comp</span> function. </li>
      <li>Added support for C++ <span class="code">insert(P&amp;&amp; otherValue)</span>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changes for <span class="code">hashtable</span> containers (<span class="code">hash_set</span>, <span class="code">fixed_hash_set</span>, etc.):
    <ul>
      <li>Added C++11 rvalue move ctor and assigment support.</li>
      <li>Added C++11 rvalue move <span class="code">push, insert </span> and <span class="code">emplace</span> support (and <span class="code">operator[]</span> for <span class="code">hash_map</span>).</li>
      <li>Added C++11 <span class="code">const_iterator</span> support.</li>
    </ul>
    Changes for <span class="code">array</span>: </li>

    <li>Added C++11 <span class="code">const_iterator</span> support.</li>
    <li>Added noexcept to swap, as required by the C++11 Standard.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Changes for <span class="code">basic_string/fixed_substring</span><span class="code"></span>:
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a bug in<span class="code"> basic_string::operator=</span> for the case of <span class="small">EASTL_ALLOCATOR_COPY_ENABLED</span> which could have caused a crash when allocators were unequal. </li>
        <li>Added C++11 <span class="code">const_iterator</span> support to <span class="code">fixed_substring</span>.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changes for <span class="code">intrusive_list</span>, <span class="code">intrusive_hashtable</span>:
    <ul>
      <li>Added C++11 const_iterator support.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changes for <span class="code">stack</span>, <span class="code">queue</span>, <span class="code">priority_queue</span>:
    <ul>
      <li>Added C++11 rvalue move ctor and assigment support.</li>
      <li>Added C++11 rvalue move  <span class="code">push</span> and <span class="code">emplace</span> support.</li>
      <li>Added other C++11 constructors. </li>
      <li>Added noexcept to swap, as required by the C++11 Standard.</li>
      <li> Added <span class="code">priority_queue::pop(value_type&amp; value)</span>, which is an extension to the C++11 Standard that allows popping move-only types (e.g. <span class="code">unique_ptr</span>). This situation is an acknowledged problem with the C++11 Standard <span class="code">priority_queue</span>. </li>
      <li>Added <span class="code">queue::validate</span> and <span class="code">stack::validate</span>. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changes for <span class="code">list_map</span>:
    <ul>
      <li>Added C++11 <span class="code">const_iterator</span> support.</li>
      <li>Used C++11 deleted function support for enforce the non-use of unsafe inherited functions.</li>
      <li>Added <span class="code">reset_lose_memory</span>, to be consistent with other containers. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changes to smart pointers:

      <li>Implemented C++11-conforming <span class="code">unique_ptr</span> and <span class="code">default_delete</span>.</li>
      <li>Deprecated <span class="code">scoped_ptr</span> and <span class="code">scoped_array</span>, as they are superceded by <span class="code">unique_ptr</span>. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changes to &lt;iterator.h&gt;:
    <ul>
      <li>Changed <span class="code">reverse_iterator::operator[]</span> implementation to be more flexible. 
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-defects.html#386">http://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-defects.html#386</a>, <a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=17883">http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=17883</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added <span class="code">make_move_if_noexcept_iterator</span>.
        <ul>
          <li><span class="code">make_move_if_noexcept_iterator</span> returns <span class="code">move_iterator&lt;Iterator&gt;</span> if the Iterator is of a noexcept type; otherwise returns <span class="code">Iterator</span> as-is. The point of this is to be able to avoid moves that can generate exceptions and instead fall back to copies or whatever the default <span class="code">IteratorType::operator*</span> returns for use by copy/move algorithms.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changes to &lt;memory.h&gt;
    <ul>
      <li>Added the following C++14 iterator  functions:
          <ul>
            <li>rbegin(Container&amp; container)</li>
            <li>rbegin(const Container&amp; container)</li>
            <li>rend(Container&amp; container)</li>
            <li>rend(const Container&amp; container)</li>
            <li>crbegin(const Container&amp; container)</li>
            <li>crend(const Container&amp; container)</li>
            <li>rbegin(T (&amp;arrayObject)[arraySize])</li>
            <li>rend(T (&amp;arrayObject)[arraySize])</li>
            <li>rbegin(std::initializer_list&lt;E&gt; ilist)</li>
            <li> rend(std::initializer_list&lt;E&gt; ilist)</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added the following C++11-related  functions:
        <ul>
          <li>uninitialized_copy_n</li>
          <li>uninitialized_move</li>
          <li>uninitialized_move_n</li>
          <li> uninitialized_move_fill</li>
          <li>uninitialized_fill_move</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added <span class="code">late_constructed</span>, which mplements a smart pointer type which separates the memory allocation of an object from  the object's construction. The primary use case is to declare a global variable of the <span class="code">late_construction</span> type, which allows the memory to be global but the constructor executes at some point after main() begins as opposed to before main, which is often dangerous for non-trivial types. </li>
      <li>Added C++11 <span class="code">uses_allocator&lt;&gt;</span>.</li>
      <li>Added C++11 <span class="code">pointer_traits</span>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changes to &lt;type_traits.h&gt;:
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed <span class="code">is_scalar</span> and <span class="code">is_fundamental</span> type traits for <span class="code">nullptr_t</span>. Previously they were false instead of true. </li>
      <li>Improved type_traits under VS2010 to be more conforming.</li>
      <li>Added C++14 <span class="code">aligned_storage_t/EASTL_ALIGNED_STORAGE_T</span>. </li>
      <li>Worked around a VS2010 bug affecting the implementation of <span class="code">add_reference</span>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changes to &lt;algorithm.h&gt;:
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented the <span class="code">rotate</span> and <span class="code">rotate_copy</span> algorithms.
        <ul>
          <li>The implementations benchmark as 1.1x - 4x faster than Microsoft/Dinkumware, gcc, and llvm <span class="code">std::rotate</span>, depending on the circumstances.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added some missing <span class="code">EASTL_ITC_NS</span> prefixes. This almost certainly will affect no users.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Privatized some previously public data in <span class="code">deque</span>, <span class="code">hashtable</span>, <span class="code">intrusive_hashtable</span>, and <span class="code">rbtree</span>. This shouldn't affect users unless they have custom containers that inherit directly from the internal <span class="code">hashtable</span> and <span class="code">rbtree</span> classes. </li>
  <li>Added <span class="code">EASTL_MOVE_INLINE</span> and <span class="code">EASTL_FORWARD_INLINE</span> macros. These allow for the same behavior as move() and forward() but without a function call. This is useful for speeding up debug code by avoid potentially very many function calls to these functions. These are usable by users in addition to being used internally to EASTL. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 2.04.00</strong> (March, 2014)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added default hash operators for <span class="code">char16_t</span> and <span class="code">char32_t</span> types if the type is natively supported by the compiler (as opposed to being a typedef or #define).</li>
  <li>Made <span class="code">&lt;eastl/iterator.h&gt;</span> <span class="code">#include &lt;iterator&gt;</span> for cases where the compiler has a bug and uses <span class="code">std::begin/end</span> with range-based for loops instead of <span class="code">eastl::/begin/end</span>. Currently there is only one compiler version affected by this: GCC 4.6. </li>
  <li>Added the <span class="code">next_permutation</span> algorithm.</li>
  <li>Added minor optimization to <span class="code">iterator::advance</span> for the case of signed vs. unsigned distances. Has the side effect of making analysis tools like Coverity be more quiet.</li>
  <li> Made <span class="code">sort</span> and <span class="code">stable_sort</span> configurable. </li>
  <li>Moved <span class="code">radix_sort</span>, <span class="code">comb_sort</span>, and <span class="code">bubble_sort</span> from sort_extra.h to sort.h, as they are relevant sorts. Backwards compatibility is maintained. </li>
  <li>Made <span class="code">vector</span> reallocations use move construction when possible. Suggested by Yee Cheng Chin.</li>
  <li>Worked around a GCC failure to compile a swap of two pointers in <span class="code">&lt;hashtable.h&gt;</span>. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 2.03.00</strong> (February 11, 2014)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added VS2013 support.
    <ul>
      <li>VS2013 supports more C++11 than previous versions, though there are some flaws in its implementation of the new functionality. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed the uninitialized family of functions in <span class="code">&lt;memory.h&gt;</span> to use  C++11 <span class="code">is_trivially_copy_assignable</span> instead of (pre-C++11) <span class="code">has_trivial_assign</span>. This was necessary because C++11 introduced deleted functions, which <span class="code">has_trivial_assign</span> has no knowledge of.    
  <li>EASTL now expects the user to also depend on EAStdC unless <span class="small">EASTL_EASTDC_VSNPRINTF</span>=0 is defined and, if so, the user must then provided their own implementation to Vsnprintf8/16/32. See config.h for details.</li>
  

  C++11 <span class="code">is_trivially_copy_assignable</span> instead of (pre-C++11) has_trivial_assign. This was necessary because C++11 introduced deleted functions, which <span class="code">has_trivial_assign</span> has no knowledge of. Reported by Jean-Philippe Flouret.</li>
  <li>Revised the <span class="code">is_convertible</span> type trait to be more portable.</li>
  <li>
    <p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Fixed some varargs usage to be strictly standards-compliant. Discovered by Coverity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a  compiler warning in <span class="code">&lt;random.h&gt;</span> regarding shadowing of 'a' and 'b'.</li>
  <li>Fixed <span class="code">hashtable</span> <span class="code">operator==</span> and <span class="code">!=</span> to work as per the C++11 Standard, along with a new unit test.</li>
  <li>Added  a C++11 <span class="code">is_permutation</span> algorithm implementation and unit test. </li>
  <li>Added <span class="code">find</span> and <span class="code">count</span> with predicate algorithm implementations.</li>

<p><strong>Version 2.02.00</strong> (December 2, 2013)</p>
<p>Release notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This release completes the support for C++11 type traits, and includes some parts of C++14 type traits. <br>
  It retains the pre-C++11 type traits as they are. Many of the traits are supported fully by pre-C++11 compilers, while some can traits can be supported only partially by pre-C++11 compilers. Not all parts of EASTL have  been converted to use these C++11 traits, though over time they will, as the C++11 traits' behavior are standardized and better tailored towards the needs of practical algorithms and containers.</li>
  <li>This release completes the support for C++11 cbegin/cend/crbegin/crend. C++14 functionality was added in EASTL 2.05.00. <br>
  See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12001410/what-is-the-reason-behind-cbegin-cend for an explanation of these. </li>
  <li>This release completes the support for C++11 algorithms. </li>
  <li>This release removes support for GCC 2.x, as its usage is unheard of for EA (and mostly elsewhere too). </li>
</ul>
<p>Changes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Added C++11/C++14 type traits: 
    <ul>
      <li>decay, conditional, add_pointer, aligned_union, rank, extent, is_member_object_pointer, is_literal_type, underlying_type, enable_if, disable_if, is_lvalue_reference, is_rvalue_reference, add_lvalue_reference, add_rvalue_reference, common_type, result_of, is_trivially_copyable, is_trivially_default_constructible, is_trivial, is_constructible, is_trivially_constructible, is_nothrow_constructible, is_default_constructible, is_nothrow_default_constructible, is_copy_constructible, is_trivially_copy_constructible, is_nothrow_copy_constructible, is_move_constructible, is_trivially_move_constructible, is_nothrow_move_constructible, is_assignable, is_trivially_assignable, is_nothrow_assignable, is_copy_assignable, is_trivially_copy_assignable, is_nothrow_copy_assignable, is_move_assignable, is_trivially_move_assignable, is_nothrow_move_assignable, is_destructible, is_trivially_destructible, is_nothrow_destructible, is_null_pointer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Added some extension type traits:
    <ul>
      <li>is_array_of_known_bounds, is_array_of_unknown_bounds, identity, static_min, static_max, is_reference_wrapper, remove_reference_wrapper, is_swappable, is_nothrow_swappable, is_reverse_iterator, is_move_iterator, is_insert_iterator, is_iterator_wrapper, unwrap_iterator.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Added  volatile support to some type traits that were lacking recognition of it. </li>
  <li>Added C++11 is_heap_until to &lt;heap.h&gt;.</li>
  <li>Updated pair&lt;&gt; to support C++11 pair functionality, with the exception of piecewise_construct.</li>
  <li>Added unique_ptr and unique_array, which are the C++11 version of scoped_ptr and scoped_array (though C++11 has no unique_array). </li>
  <li>Added C++11 the move, move_backward, and move_n algorithms. </li>
  <li>Re-wrote the copy and copy_backward algorithms. They should now follow the C++11 standard and be at least as performant as previously, and in many cases more so due to better detection of memmove-able types. </li>
  <li>Made eastl::forward(T), eastl::move(T), and eastl::move_if_noexcept(T) work on pre-C++11 compilers, though they work by simply returning T as-is. </li>
  <li>Added a complete C++11 reference_wrapper declaration, though  with no definition. </li>
  <li>Removed support for GCC 2.x, as its usage is unheard of for EA (and mostly elsewhere too). </li>
  <li>Added the C++11 minmax, minmax_element, and iota algorithms. </li>
  <li>Added clang support to a couple type traits that weren't using it and thus were using less-compliant implementations of the trait.</li>
  <li>Fixed the is_array type trait to include unbounded arrays (e.g. int[]). </li>
  <li>Fixed the definition of <span class="code">EASTL_TYPE_TRAIT_remove_all_extents_CONFORMANCE</span>. </li>
  <li>Added min/max specializations for common scalars. </li>
  <li>Added support for initializer lists in the min/max algorithms. So now you can say this: <span class="code">i = eastl::min({3, i, j});</span> </li>
  <li>Added cbegin, cend, crbegin, crend support for all remaining containers that didn't previously have it. Also added the global cbegin and cend functions (C++14). </li>
  <li>Added type traits helpers: <span class="code">EASTL_DECLARE_INTEGRAL(T)</span> and <span class="code">EASTL_DECLARE_FLOATING_POINT(T)</span>. These will be used by EAStdC's int128_t/uint128_t in the future. </li>
  <li>Removed reverse_iterator related typedef's and methods from <span class="code">hashtable(T)</span>.  This change shouldn't break any code because the related code didn't work (or in many cases compile) in the past.</li>
  <li>Added GCC 4.8.1 support, which mostly amounted to working around some warnings. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 2.01.00</strong> (November 15, 2013)</p>
<p>Release notes</p>
<ul>
  <li>This version added  inline asm optimized <span class="code">fill</span> and <span class="code">fill_n</span> implementations for gcc/clang x86/x64 targets. While the unit tests pass, it may be that something  was missed and affects code generation in other projects. </li>
</ul>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
    <li>Added a new hashtable method called <span class="code">find_range_by_hash</span> that lets users iterate over all nodes in a hash bucket given a hash value.</li>
    <li>Implemented small improvement to <span class="code">vector::set_capacity(size_type n)</span> to optimize for the common case that n is 0. Aside from being faster, this results in such cases not calling resize(n), which currently creates a value_type temporary on the stack, which may be a problem if value_type is large. </li>
    <li> Added inline asm and intrinsic specializations for the <span class="code">fill</span> and <span class="code">fill_n</span> algorithms.</li>
    <li>Added <span class="code">ring_buffer::set_capacity</span>. It works like other containers' set_capacity. </li>
    <li>
        <span> Added C++11 is_sorted_until function, with associated unit tests:</span><br>
        <span class='code'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;template&lt;typename ForwardIterator&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ForwardIterator is_sorted_until(ForwardIterator
        first, ForwardIterator last)</span><br><br>

        <span class='code'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;template&lt;typename ForwardIterator, typename
        Compare&gt;<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ForwardIterator is_sorted_until(ForwardIterator
        first, ForwardIterator last, Compare compare)</span>
    </li>

    <li>Added C++11 prev and next iterator functions, plus associated unit tests:<br>
          <span class="code"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;template&lt;typename InputIterator&gt;<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;InputIterator next(InputIterator it, difference_type n = 1);<br>
     <br>
          </span><span class="code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;template&lt;typename InputIterator&gt;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;InputIterator prev(InputIterator it, difference_type n = 1);</span><br>
    </li>
    <li>Made it so <span class="code">slist::insert_after(position, first, last)</span> returns iterator instead of void. This was to match C++11's behavior in the equivalent class, forward_list. </li>
    <li>Added full C++ initialization list support for the following classes:
    <ul>
      <li>deque</li>
      <li>map, set, multimap, multiset </li>
      <li>list</li>
      <li>slist</li>
      <li>hash_map, hash_set, hash_multimap, hash_multiset</li>
      <li>fixed_hash_map, fixed_hash_set, fixed_hash_multimap, fixed_hash_multiset. </li>
      <li>fixed_map, fixed_set, fixed_multimap, fixed_multiset </li>
      <li>fixed_slist</li>
      <li>vector_map, vector_set, vector_multimap, vector_multiset.</li>
      <li>ring_buffer</li>
      <li>stack, queue, priority_queue (C++11 doesn't define initializer list support for these.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>The initialization_list class is supported under all C++ compilers, but brace initialization syntax is supported only by sufficient C++11 compilers. Example brace initialization usage: <span class="code">eastl::map&lt;int, const char*&gt; myMap = { {0,&quot;a&quot;}, {1,&quot;b&quot;} };</span> </p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 2.00.00</strong> (July 22nd, 2013)</p>
<p>This release continues adding C++11 functionality. There is a lot of functionality added here, and it may possibly introduce compatibility problems, so please let us know if you run into any problems. If you are using containers with custom allocators of your own construction, you need to make sure that operator== is defined for the allocator or else you can get compile errors which you didn't get with previous EASTL versions. </p>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added the C++11 align function and an extension align_advance function to &lt;memory.h&gt;, with a unit test.</li>
  <li>Added allocator_malloc, which is an allocator that uses malloc. </li>
  <li>Added the <span class="small">EASTL_MOVE_SEMANTICS_ENABLED</span> config define.</li>
  <li>Added &lt;initializer_list.h&gt;, which defines std::initializer_list if not already provided by the Standard Library. </li>
  <li>Added C++11 move&lt;&gt; and forward&lt;&gt; to &lt;EASTL/utility.h&gt; . </li>
  <li>Added C++11 move_iterator to &lt;EASTL/iterator.h&gt;.</li>
  <li>Added C++11 addressof (20.6.12.1).</li>
  <li>Added initial C++11 move and move_backward algorithms to &lt;EASTL/algorithm.h&gt;.
    <ul>
      <li>These are initial versions which don't take advantage of memmove when possible. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Added some C++11 basic_string and fixed_string functionality, along with unit tests:
    <ul>
      <li>move constuctor and functions:
        <ul>
          <li> basic_string(this_type&amp;&amp; x);</li>
          <li>basic_string(this_type&amp;&amp; x, const allocator_type&amp; allocator);</li>
          <li>this_type&amp; operator=(this_type&amp;&amp; x);</li>
          <li>this_type&amp; assign(this_type&amp;&amp; x);</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>shrink_to_fit(), though it's identical in behavior to the existing vector::set_capacity(string::npos);</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>cbegin, cend, crbegin, crend. </li>
      <li>initializer list support:
        <ul>
          <li>basic_string(std::initializer_list&lt;T&gt; init, const allocator_type&amp; allocator = <span class="small">EASTL_BASIC_STRING_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR</span>);</li>
          <li>this_type&amp; operator=(std::initializer_list&lt;T&gt; ilist);</li>
          <li>this_type&amp; assign(std::initializer_list&lt;T&gt;);</li>
          <li>iterator insert(const_iterator p, std::initializer_list&lt;T&gt;);</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>functions that took iterator in C++03 but now take const_iterator in C++11 (e.g. insert(const_iterator, value_type c)).</li>
      <li>Added noexcept declarators as applicable to member functions. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Added some C++11 vector functionality, along with unit tests:
    <ul>
      <li>move constuctor and functions:
        <ul>
          <li>vector(this_type&amp;&amp; x);</li>
          <li>vector(this_type&amp;&amp; x, const allocator_type&amp; allocator);</li>
          <li>this_type&amp; operator=(this_type&amp;&amp; x);</li>
          <li>void push_back(T&amp;&amp; value);</li>
          <li>Not yet supported: insert(const_iterator position, T&amp;&amp; value);</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>shrink_to_fit(), though it's identical in behavior to the existing vector::set_capacity(string::npos);</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <ul><li>cbegin, cend, crbegin, crend. </li>
    <li>initializer list support:
      <ul>
        <li>vector(std::initializer_list&lt;T&gt; ilist, const allocator_type&amp; allocator = <span class="small">EASTL_VECTOR_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR</span>);</li>
        <li>this_type&amp; operator=(std::initializer_list&lt;T&gt; ilist);</li>
        <li>void assign(std::initializer_list&lt;T&gt; ilist);</li>
        <li>iterator insert(const_iterator position, std::initializer_list&lt;T&gt; ilist);</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>vector(const this_type&amp; x, const allocator_type&amp; allocator) </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>functions that took iterator in C++03 but now take const_iterator in C++11 (e.g. insert(const_iterator, value_type c)).</li>
    <li>Added noexcept declarators as applicable to member functions. </li>
    <li>Not yet supported: 
      <ul>
        <li>iterator emplace(const_iterator position, Args&amp;&amp;... args);</li>
        <li>void emplace_back(Args&amp;&amp;... args);</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Added fixed_string global operator+ in various incarnations, including rvalue reference versions, and unit tests to go with it.
    <ul>
      <li>This was done in order to support C++11 move operations in fixed_string and basic_string, but it turns out that it also fixes a crash bug that would occur if used an expression like this: (someFixedString1 + someFixedString2).swap(someString). Previously the + operator would result in a string and not a fixed_string and the wrong swap would be called. Nobody has ever reported this, either because they didn't try such an obscure thing or they tried it and it crashed and they simply did something alternative. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Added inline declarations to class allocator member function declarations; possibly to avoid warnings that occur with some compilers in some situations. </li>
  <li>Added is_standard_layout type traits support. This is a C++11 type trait that is like is_pod but is more relaxed and better identifies structs that you can do things like memset with. As with is_pod, is_standard_layout mistakenly returns false in older compiler versions (see <span class="small">EASTL_TYPE_TRAIT_is_standard_layout_CONFORMANCE</span>), due to compiler limitations. You can use <span class="small">EASTL_DECLARE_STANDARD_LAYOUT</span> to work around these limitations. </li>
  <li>Added eastl::begin, eastl::end to &lt;eastl/iterator.h&gt;, to support C++11 functionality. Due to a bug in GCC 4.6, this iterator is not defined when compiling with GCC 4.6 (and 4.6 only). If you need to use GCC 4.6 then you can use std::begin/std::end if that's available to you. As of this writing (June 2013), the most commonly used Android compiler is 4.6-based, though it provides an option to build with 4.7 (e.g. by having a <span class="code">package.AndroidNDK.toolchain-version=4.7</span> global property in Framework/nant).</li>
  <li>Added enum value kNodeSize to deque. Suggested by Frostbite.</li>
  <li>Added a ring_buffer additional template parameter: Allocator. It defaults to the allocator of the container. </li>
  <li>Added ring_buffer constructors: explicit ring_buffer(const allocator_type&amp; allocator) and ring_buffer(size_type cap, const allocator_type&amp; allocator).</li>
  <li>Added new config define: <span class="small">EASTL_ALLOCATOR_MIN_ALIGNMENT</span>. This identifies what the eastl::allocator lowest possible min returned alignment is. Updated allocator.h and allocator_malloc.h to use this.</li>
  <li>Added kHashtableAllocFlagBuckets to hashtable.h, which replaces class hashtable&lt;&gt;::kAllocFlagBuckets. The latter is exists but is deprecated. This change is to make it easier for users to use the enumeration.</li>
  <li>Added const get_allocator() and const get_overflow_allocator functions to various containers that didn't have it previously. </li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a potential VC++ warning in string.cpp: warning C4365: 'initializing' : conversion from '__int64' to 'size_t', signed/unsigned mismatch.</li>
  <li>Fixed eastl.natvis file (VC++ debug file) problem with map/set visualization. Reported by Mark Haines. </li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated hashtable.cpp to use ceilf instead of ceil, for a minor performance improvement. Suggested by Frostbite.</li>
  <li>Incremented eastl.natvis file support for vector and array objects to display up to six instead of the previous three.</li>
  <li>Improved fixed_list, fixed_slist, fixed_map, fixed_set constructor efficiency by making the fixed buffer base type be initialized only once. Suggested by Henrik Karlsson.</li>
  <li>uninitialized_move, uninitialized_relocate_start, uninitialized_move_abort, and uninitialized_move_commit from &lt;EASTL/memory.h&gt; have been renamed to uninitialized_relocate, etc. This is because it collides with C++11 concepts regarding move. C++11 doesn't actually define an uninitialized_move function, though it implies the meaning of such a thing, and we may implement such a function in the future. No users are likely to be affected by this change, as it was code that was mostly or entirely internally used.</li>
</ul>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.18.00</strong> (June 4, 2013)</p>
<p>Release notes </p>
<ul>
  <li>The random_shuffle algorithm has moved from &lt;algorithm.h&gt; to &lt;random.h&gt;, though for the time being &lt;algorithm.h&gt; #includes &lt;random.h&gt;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added the following C++11 algorithms:
    <ul>
      <li> all_of</li>
      <li>any_of</li>
      <li> none_of</li>
      <li>copy_if</li>
      <li>copy_n</li>
      <li>find_if_not</li>
      <li>shuffle (see below)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Updated random_shuffle to support C++11 rvalue arguments when possible, as per the C++11 Standard for random_shuffle. </li>
  <li>Added a  <span class="small">EASTL_ASSERT(mpEnd &lt; mpCapacity)</span> assert to fixed_vector::push_back.</li>
  <li>Added &lt;random.h&gt;, which hosts a small subset of C++11 random functionality for the purpose of supporting shuffle algorithms.</li>
  <li>Added &lt;numeric_limits.h&gt;, with C++11-level support for numeric limits.</li>
  <li>Added str_less&lt;&gt; to functional, as a complement to the existing str_equal&lt;&gt;.</li>
  <li>Made the wide basic_string implementation (e.g. wstring, string32, etc.) do unsigned comparisons where the character type is signed. In practice this won't likely affect any users because all 16 bit character types we use are already unsigned, and there are no negative 32 bit signed unicode characters. </li>
  <li>Added the following new type_traits, all of which are present in C++11:
    <ul>
      <li> make_signed</li>
        <li>make_unsigned</li>
        <li> add_const</li>
        <li>add_volatile</li>
        <li>add_cv</li>
        <li>add_reference</li>
        <li>remove_reference</li>
        <li> remove_pointer</li>
        <li> remove_extent</li>
        <li>remove_all_extents</li>
        <li>remove_const</li>
        <li>remove_volatile</li>
        <li>remove_cv</li>
        <li> aligned_storage</li>
    </ul>
  There are additional C++11 type traits that will be added on an as-needed, or by-request basis.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.17.01</strong> (Mar 27, 2013)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Providing support to eaconfig to suppress valgrind errors/warning. In addition, adding a valgrind suppressions file to EASTL to suppress warnings about va_list using unitialized variables.</li>
  <li>Resolved unix64-clang issues that define global new operators.</li>
  <li>Submission certification changes required by EAMT.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.17.00</strong> (Mar 4, 2013)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Revised core_allocator_adapter.h to allow redefining EASTLDefaultAllocator to be CoreAllocatorAdapter. Suggested by Ryan Butterfoss.</li>
  <li>This release formally supports the Samsung TV platform (<span class="small">EA_PLATFORM_SAMSUNG_TV</span>), though previous versions support this platform in practice already. </li>
  <li>Changed <span class="small">EASTL_LIST_SIZE_CACHE</span> from 0 to 1. It was originally 0 due to memory-conscious platforms.</li>
  <li>Made deque::set_allocator able to safely install a new entirely different allocator, though only right after construction. Previously this wasn't possible. Submitted by Jeff Duncan as part of an effort to allow the queue class to be able to work with deque containers with custom-assigned allocators. </li>
  <li>Improved fixed_string::set_capacity to truly free allocated memory when needed. </li>
  <li> Added fixed_string::full, has_overflowed, can_overflow. These match the existing functionality in vector and other fixed-size containers. </li>
  <li>Added functions which implement UTF8 &harr; UCS encoding conversion: CtorConvert, append_convert, assign_convert.</li>
  <li>Revised <span class="small">EASTL_LIST_PROXY_ENABLED</span> to be disabled under the SN compiler, as it can generate aliasing warnings with it starting with SN compiler v430+.</li>
  <li>Added EASTL_OPERATOR_EQUALS_OTHER_ENABLED to enable previously disabled code.</li>
  <li>Changed EASTL_LIST_SIZE_CACHE from 0 to 1. It was originally 0 due to memory-conscious platforms.</li>
  <li>Some documentation updates, additions, and revisions.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.16.00</strong> (December 10th, 2012)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed eastl::safe_object::has_unique_reference() bug, in which it was usually returning the wrong answer. Reported by Matt Miner. </li>
  <li>Added the ability to override the default allocator used by CoreAllocatorAdapter &lt;core_allocator_adapter.h&gt;, through <span class="small">EASTL_CORE_ALLOCATOR_ADAPTER_GET_DEFAULT_CORE_ALLOCATOR</span>. Submitted by Ryan Butterfoss. </li>
  <li>Added WiiU support.</li>
  <li>Added VS2012 &quot;natvis&quot; debug helpers via the doc/EASTL.natvis file. Natvis files are the successor to Microsoft's AutoExp.dat files for viewing debug information for user-defined types. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.15.04</strong> (November 5th, 2012)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Removed an 'if' in selection_sort which was unnecessary. Reported by James Park. </li>
  <li>Added hash&lt;string16&gt; and hash&lt;string32&gt; for the purpose of supporting C++11 compilers that treat wchar_t as being different from char16_t and char32_t. Suggested by Frederic Lauzon.</li>
  <li>Fixed VC++ type traits support for VS2012+. VS2012 enables type traits support by default and no longer uses the _HAS_TR1 define to identify it. Reported by Henrik Karlsson.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.15.03</strong> (August 7, 2012)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Revised string hashes (functional.h) to use uint32_t instead of size_t for calculations, so that the result is the same on 32 and 64 bit machines. The strength of the hash is weakened on 64 bit machines but some amount. Users can override string hashes to provide their own custom versions if desired. Suggested by Darryl Gates. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.15.02</strong> (July 3, 2012)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improved platform portability.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.15.01</strong> (June 4, 2012)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Removed kAlignmentOffset, kKeyAlignment, and kValueAlignment enum values from container definitions, to avoid evaluating the alignment of an incomplete type.</li>
  <li>Added FreeBSD and WinRT support.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in vector for push_back(value_type&amp;) and resize(size, n, value_type&amp;) for the case of the value_type coming from within the vector. This bug was introduced in v1.15.00. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.15.00</strong> (May 7, 2012)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
    <li>The base type of eastl_size_t now defaults to size_t instead of uint32_t. For backwards compatibility the symbol EASTL_SIZE_T_32BIT can be defined to 1 if this causes an issue in 64-bit configurations.</li>
  <li>Implemented a unit test for bitvector, which was previously unimplemented.</li>
  <li>
    <p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Fixed broken 'bitvector::end() const' implementation, found during unit test implementation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Fixed broken ' bitvector::erase(reverse_iterator, reverse_iterator)' implementation, found during unit test implementation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"> Fixed broken bitvector global operator (e.g. ==, &lt;) declarations, found during unit test implementation.</p>
    <p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"></p>
  </li>
  <li>Added bitvector::test(), set(), and get_container(). test allows you to directly test for a bit being set and specify a default value if the bit position is outside the bitvector's range. bitvector differs from bitset in that the bitvector size is dynamic. set is the complement of test. get_container is needed both for consistency with other adapter containers and so you can manipulate the container allocator. </li>
  <li>Significantly improved performance of hash_map::operator[]. Based on an idea from Strati Zerbinis.</li>
  <li>Fixed a possible compiler warning in hashtable's distance_fw_impl.</li>
  <li>Added union_cast&lt;&gt;, which allows for easy-to-read casting between types that are unrelated but have binary equivalence. The classic use case is converting between float and int bit representations. <br>
    <span class="code"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;template &lt;typename DestType, typename SourceType&gt; DestType union_cast(SourceType)</span>  </li>
  <li><span class="small">EASTL_CT_ASSERT</span> now uses C++ static_assert when available, through EABase. </li>
  <li>Revised usage of 'enum : size_type' is disabled for VS2011+, as VS2011 has a bug which results in mistaken compiler errors when using it.</li>
  <li>Changed bitset::reference friend declaration to be more compliant with the C++ Standard. </li>
  <li>Removed the definition of enumerated value kAlignment from vector, list, slist, deque, basic_string, and string_abstract, as well as kNodeSize from deque.  This is so that recursively defined structs containing containers of themselves, such as <span class="code">struct Test { eastl::vector&lt;Test&gt; children; };</span>, can be compiled. The definition of kAlignment required the evaluation of the alignment of an incomplete type.</li>
  <li>Revised the implementation of eastl::vector to reduce the size of user binaries in practice.</li>
  <li>Support for the clang compiler in unix64 configurations has been added.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.14.00</strong> (February 28, 2012)</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added PSVita platform support (EA_PLATFORM_PSP2).</li>
  <li>Added linked_ptr::detach. Implemented by Ryan Ingram. </li>
  <li>Fixed EASTL bitset operator &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; to not have a shift integer wraparound error for the case of shifting by 0, on some platforms. </li>
  <li>Fixed merge_sort_buffer possible error due to integer rollover for the case of huge sort sets. Such a bug would only have been seen with cases of sorting 2 billion+ elements on a 32 bit computer. This was done in response to reading <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html">http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html</a>, and it seems on first examination to be the only case within the EASTL codebase. </li>

<p><strong>Version 1.13.03</strong> (January 11, 2012)</p>
<p>Release notes</p>
<ul>
  <li> This release may in some cases trigger a compile error under VC++ due to a bug in VC++'s crtdbg.h:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crtdbg.h(628) : warning C4005: '_malloca' : macro redefinition <br>
  The only fixes for this are to make sure &lt;crtdbg.h&gt; is included before &lt;malloc.h&gt; or to get a fixed version of the Microsoft compiler or standard libraries. The bug appears to exist in at least VS2005 and VS2008.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changed <span class="small">EASTL_STD_ITERATOR_CATEGORY_ENABLED</span> default value from 1 to 0. This could break some existing users, but was ovewhelmingly approved by users. </li>
  <li>Made fixed_vector::set_capacity fully support the desired behavior. Previously the full behavior was left as a to-do. </li>
  <li>Revised fixed container has_overflowed to report only if it has overflowed into the overflow allocator and not return true if it merely used all (but no more) of the space in the fixed allocator. Left the old full() function to behave like it used to (i.e. report true if the fixed allocator was full but no overflow). </li>
  <li>Added fixed container can_overflow(). </li>
  <li>Fixed safe_ptr's use of the undeclared <em>InitSafePtr</em> function to instead use <em>reset</em>. Reported by Hector Yu. </li>
  <li>Fixed safe_object::remove infinite loop. Reported by Hector Yu. </li>
  <li>bitset now supports 8 and 16 bit words in addition to the 32, 64, and 128 bit words it previously supported. These are useful for the case that you need to export the data to some other system that uses 8 or 16 bit word bit arrays.</li>
  <li>This version explicitly supports the Freebox platform. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.13.02</strong> (October 21, 2011)</p>
<p>Release notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This version includes a change that may break some users. The container reset function has been renamed to reset_lose_memory. This was done because the name &quot;reset&quot; appears to have been too simple of a name and users unfamiliar with STL were thinking it meant the same thing as clear(). The change is intentionally breaking because it forces users of reset() (most of which appear to be mistaken) to explicitly choose to use reset_lose_memory. For the time being, you can set the <span class="small">EASTL_RESET_ENABLED</span> option to enabled (if not already) in order to allow reset to work (though it just calls reset_lose_memory).</li>
  <li>This version introduces the <span class="small">EASTL_SIZE_T_32BIT</span> config option, as described below. It is set to 1 by default in this release for backward compatibility, but a future EASTL release will set it to 0. This will result in compiler warnings in user code that assumes eastl_size_t is 32 bits all the time (even on 64 bit platforms). 64 bit users are encouraged to fix their code now so they will be prepared for this in the future. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Additions </p>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for the CLang compiler in both 32 and 64 bit modes, tested under iOS and OS X. </li>
  <li>Added CTR (Nintendo 3DS) support.</li>
  <li>Added a <em>partition</em> algorithm implementation. Provided by James Smith. </li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a possible compile error for the case of <span class="small">EASTL_ALLOCATOR_COPY_ENABLED</span> being enabled. </li>
  <li>Fixed an intrusive_list compile failure for the case that <span class="small">EASTL_VALIDATE_INTRUSIVE_LIST</span> is enabled under some versions of GCC. GCC versions prior to ~v4.4 have problems with may_alias structs that have member functions. </li>
  <li>Fixed a VC++ type_traits error for the case that the user's build file explicitly disables TR1 support via <span class="code">#define _TR1 0</span>. Reported by Arpit Baldeva. </li>
  <li>Fixed a hash container bug where the copy_code function usage might generate a compile error. </li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Renamed the container reset() function to reset_lose_memory(). For the time being, you can set the <span class="small">EASTL_RESET_ENABLED</span> option to enabled in order to allow reset to work (though it just calls reset_lose_memory).</li>
  <li>Implemented the fixed_list::splice functions. Previously they were not supported. </li>
  <li>Added the <span class="small">EASTL_SIZE_T_32BIT</span> config option, which controls whether eastl_size_t is size_t or is uint32_t. These two are different on 64 bit platforms. Currently it is set to 0 for backward compatibility, which means that eastl_size_t is uint32_t. You can force it to size_t by setting <span class="small">EASTL_SIZE_T_32BIT</span> to 0 in your build. A future EASTL release will set it to 0, as by default <span class="small">EASTL</span> intends to be compatible with std <span class="small">STL</span> to the extent possible. In nant builds you can configure <span class="small">EASTL_SIZE_T_32BIT</span> via the masterconfig.xml file globalproperties with <span class="small">EASTL</span>.<span class="small">EASTL_SIZE_T_32BIT=1</span>.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.13.01</strong> (June 6, 2011)</p>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added ability to specify the bitset word type as an optional template parameter to bitset. This is in addition to the <span class="small">EASTL_BITSET_WORD_SIZE</span> option that was added to EASTL 1.13.00, with the primary difference being that this is an option that's usable per-bitset as opposed to being a global default.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a compile error under the Airplay platform (mobile middleware) due to #including &lt;yvals.h&gt;. Airplay pretends it's VC++ but isn't, and so fails when compiling code that's VC++-specific. </li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated vector::DoInsertFromIterator and vector::DoInsertValues to be more efficient. Provided by Jean-Philippe Flouret.</li>
  <li>Added a specialization to equal_to_2/not_equal_to_2/less_2 to allow using the same two types.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.13.00</strong> (May 5, 2011)</p>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added provisional tim_sort algorithm. Measurements suggest that this is the fastest of the stable sort algorithms. quick_sort is still faster in general for random data but is not stable (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability). Wrote a sort benchmarking system to go with this as well as a &quot;Sorting Algorithm Shootout&quot; paper. </li>
  <li>Added <span class="small">EASTL_TYPE_TRAIT_</span>xxx<span class="small">_CONFORMANCE</span> for all type traits xxx. This indicates whether the type trait is fully conforming as opposed to having weaknesses.</li>
  <li>Added VC++ type_traits specializations that take advantage of native VC++ type trait support.</li>
  <li>Added dual-type operator() to binary_compose. Implemented by James Smith. </li>
  <li>Added copy_if algorithm. Implemented by James Smith. </li>
  <li>Added the scoped_ptr::detach function which forgets the owned pointer. This is different from the scoped_ptr::reset function which deletes the pointer. Same for scoped_array. Suggested by Andrew Willmott. </li>
  <li>Added a codestripper script for the package.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug in the <span class="code">reverse</span> algorithm which could crash on reversing an empty range. </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in hashtable.h that could result in a compile error on recent GCC versions such as &quot;error: 'predicate' cannot be used as a function&quot;.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bugs in memory.h's usage of operator new that were preventing the following from working: vector&lt;const SomeClassWithCtorThatTakesAnInt&gt; v(intArray.begin(), intArray.end()); Submitted by Dave Wall. </li>
  <li>Fixed safe_ptr to be buildable, and added a unit test for it. Submitted by Dejan Ivkovic.</li>
  <li>Fixed an SNC strict aliasing problem with intrusive_list. Reported by Toan Pham.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented workaround for SN failure to compile priority_queue.h. </li>
  <li>Added a FAQ entry on how to sort by pointers or array indexes to objects instead of directly by objects.</li>
  <li>Added some new developer debug options: <span class="small">EASTL_DEV_DEBUG</span> and <span class="small">EASTL_DEV_ASSERT</span>. These allow for developer debugging of EASTL, but aren't enabled for regular debug users by default since they are for internal code validation and not user input validation. </li>
  <li>Added <span class="small">EASTL_BITSET_WORD_SIZE</span> config option, and set it to be 8 for SPU instead of the default 4 for SPU. Suggested by Malcolm Liu. </li>
  <li>Updated code for various containers to better support const types (e.g. vector&lt;const int&gt;). Support of const types is only partially implemented at this point, but is intended to be fully implemented in the future. Note that not all functionality can be possible with const types; for example vector::insert(iterator) can't be used in a const type container. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p><strong>Version 1.12.01 </strong> (January 19, 2011)</p>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added <span class="code">iterator vector::erase_unsorted(iterator position)</span> and the reverse_iterator equivalent. These allow for significantly faster performance (due to less copying), but at the cost of not preserving container order. </li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug which resulted in the wrong return value from     int <span class="code">basic_string::compare(size_type pos1, size_type n1, const basic_string&amp; x, size_type pos2, size_type n2) const</span>. Reported by Boris Kropivinitsky.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added <span class="small">EASTL_STD_CPP_ONLY</span> config option to allow disabling of C++ language extensions where they might otherwise be useful. 


  <span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-size:12.0pt;">There are a couple cases in EASTL where compiler extensions are used to significant advantage where there is no alternative means of achieving that advantage.</span> </li>
  <li>Added <span class="small">EASTL_RESET_ENABLED</span> config option to allow disabling of the container reset functionality. When disabled, the reset function acts as clear. </li>
  <li>Added a print <span class="small">EXIT</span>(n) at the end of the unit tests on wii to support automated running/testing on Wii.</li>
  <li>Made it so that unit test printf calls get routed through a custom EASTLTest_Printf function, which does platform-specific things as needed.</li>
  <li>Made the assert function on Android use the Android log print function, as printf doesn't work on Android.</li>
  <li>Implemented a specialization of the push_back function for fixed_vector which results in significantly less code generation for the case of overflow being disabled. Implemented by Jonathan Lawlor and Andreas Fredriksson.</li>
  <li>fixed_ containers now have a constructor that accepts an overflow allocator argument.</li>
  <li>fixed_ containers now have a get_overflow_allocator function. Previously you had to use container.get_allocator().get_overflow_allocator(), which was tedious and not obvious. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p><strong>Version 1.12.00</strong> (November 5, 2010)</p>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added unary_compose and  binary_compose to functional.h. Provided by James Smith. </li>
  <li>Added bitset::from_uint32, from_uint64, to_uint32, and to_uint64 functions. The addition of a uint64_t constructor was skipped because it caused conflicts with existing code and portability problems for existing std STL code. </li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug in vector::erase(reverse_iterator, reverse_iterator) and deque equivalent. Reported by David Benson.</li>
  <li>Changed smart_ptr.h to use const_cast in order to get around potential compiler errors with some types. Reported by James Irizarry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improved efficiency of intrusive_hashtable_find by removing an unnecessary copy. Reported by Avery Lee.</li>
  <li>use_first and use_second now have a 


argument_type member typedef. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>This version has been updated to support PS3 SN 330, CodeWarrior 1.3, and Android platform.</li>

<p><strong>Version 1.11.02</strong> (April 5, 2010)</p>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added Mobile support: iPhone, Palm Pre, and Android. More mobile platforms to follow. </li>
  <li>Added list::push_front_uninitialized, to match push_back_uninitialized. Suggested by Henrik Karlsson.</li>
  <li>Added intrusive_hashtable::remove(const value_type&amp;). Implemented by Jon Parise. </li>
  <li>Added the <span class="small">EASTL_ALLOCATOR_COPY_ENABLED</span> config option, which currently defaults to 0 (disabled). This option causes allocators to be copied in container operator= and swap. </li>
  <li>Added key_comp() to map, set, etc. containers and added key_eq to hash_* containers. </li>
  <li>Added ctor to CoreAllocatorAdapter which specifies flags. Suggested by Brian Hixon. </li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Switched usage of placment new to explicitly use the global version ::new, and opposed to plain new. Without the :: prefix, the compiler looks for operator new as a member of the allocated class before using the global version. We want to always use the global version. In the analagous case in C++ Standard STL, global new is expected to be explicitly used. Reported by Scott Penso. </li>
  <li>Removed some GCC 4.4 Linux warnings related to strict aliasing. </li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added PS3 SN compiler v320 and later compatibility. The new compiler was generating some new warnings. </li>
  <li>Changed intrusive_hashtable_iterator(value_type* pNode, value_type** pBucket = NULL) to no longer have a NULL default argument, as using NULL unilaterally would result in a crash. </li>
  <li>Moved insertion_sort_simple into an internal namespace, as it's not intended to be a public function and doesn't act identically to the other sort functions. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.11.01</strong> (November 18, 2009) </p>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;none&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed linked_ptr and linked_array ctor bug whereby in some cases mpPrev and mpNext would be uninitialized. Reported by Chris Brown. </li>
  <li>Fixed bug in merge_sort_buffer (used by merge_sort and stable_sort) which caused it to not compile when sorting a deque. Reported by Ian Barkley-Yeung.</li>
  <li>Fixed Linux64 GCC compiler warning with that could occur with the iterator advance function. Reported by Chen Yang.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in ring_buffer::ring_buffer(const Container&amp; x) which could cause a crash if x was empty. </li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>get_overflow_allocator / set_overflow_allocator are available for all fixed_ container allocators. Example usage: someFixedList.get_allocator().set_overflow_allocator(x);</li>
  <li>allocator::operator=(const allocator&amp;) now copies the name from the source allocator, same as the allocator copy ctor was already doing. </li>
  <li>Made it so push_back can't be called on a vector_set, vector_map, vector_multiset, vector_multimap, due to being inherently unsafe. Suggested by Mikael Hedberg and Johan Torp. </li>
  <li>Updated unit test char16_t support to use EACHAR16(&quot;&quot;) instead of L&quot;&quot;. This allows for C++0x compatibility. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.11.00</strong> (October 5, 2009) </p>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added <span class="code">vector::</span> and <span class="code">list::push_back_unintialized</span> after some discussion with users regarding the appropriateness and usefulness of it. This allows the user to push_back an element which is unintialized and the user manually initializes it with placement new. Example usage: <span class="code">new(widgetVector.push_back_uninitialized()) Widget(37);</span></li>
  <li>Added support for the PSP SN compiler. This amounted to using #defines to work around a couple compiler limitations.</li>
  <li>Added <span class="small">EASTL_DEBUGPARAMS_LEVEL</span> option to allow disabling of debug names.</li>
  <li>Added a shared_ptr constructor which allows specifying a custom deleter type for constructor argument U. This addition isn't entirely satisfactory, but there isn't a good solution to this problem. Suggested by Olivier Nallet. </li>
  <li>Added <font class="code">void hashtable::clear(bool clearBuckets)</font>, which allows clearing buckets as well as elements. Using clear(true) returns a hash table to its newly constructed state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug in bitset for the case of shifting some bitsets by amounts greater than the machine word size. Submitted by Andrew Willmott.</li>
  <li>Fixed priority_queue::validate to use the custom Compare type when present. Previously it was always using the default. Submitted by Tom Bui.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in the change_heap function whereby it wasn't using a temp variable like the other heap functions. Submitted by Andrew Willmott and Tom Bui. </li>
  <li>Fixed small bug in string::reserve whereby it could reserve one byte more than the user asks for. The bug was introduced in EASTL 1.07.00 while fixing a set_capacity bug. </li>
  <li>Fixed potential PS3 compile error in vector_multiset::insert. Reported by Henrik Karlsson.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Made fixed-size containers delay their memory pool initialization until needed. This results in an extra four bytes per fixed-size container but allows for faster construction and faster use of containers whose memory pools aren't fully used. This is especially useful for temporary containers on the application stack. Implemented by Stefan Boberg. </li>
  <li><span class="code">push_back(void)</span> now returns <span class="code">value_type&amp;</span> instead of void. Affects vector, deque, list, and ring_buffer.</li>
  <li><span class="code">push_front(void)</span> now returns <span class="code">value_type&amp;</span> instead of void. Affects deque, list, and slist.</li>
  <li>Converted some remaining usage of 'static const size_type' to 'enum' in order to reduce debug symbols.</li>
  <li>Updated unit tests to work with PS3 SDK 270 and later, which introduce a new aligned global operator new. </li>
  <li>Added some bounds checking assertions to array.h.</li>
  <li>Revised the implementation of array::at to not fix bounds for the user. </li>
  <li>Fixed some incorrectly failing bitset unit tests on Linux64.</li>

<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug in deque introduced in v 1.10.01 whereby memory usage could slowly increase without bound. With this bug fix, memory usage fixed and is slightly improved over what it was prior to v 1.10.01. Reported by Avery Lee. </li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improved performance of deque insertion operations by avoiding some gratuitous iterator copying.</li>
  <li>Added the <font size="-1">EASTL_ALLOCATOR_EXPLICIT_ENABLED</font> option,  whihc causes the allocator constructor (allocator(const char*)) to be explicit. Without it being explicit code like <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">wstring str(&quot;hello&quot;);</font> would compile but not likely be doing what the user wanted, as the string here is the implicitly used allocator's name and not the string value.

  <li>Added list::insert with no value_type to match slist and vector::push_back(void). Implemented by Luc Isaak. </li>
  <li>Added specialized global swap for basic_string to be consistent with rest of EASTL. </li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed longstanding bug in fixed_hash_map/set whereby an assertion or crash would occur on construction if the bucket block size was identical to the node (value_type) size. Previously this bug was documented as &quot;don't do that&quot; since all you had to do to fix it was change your bucket count to work around it. But this fix removes that limitation. Previously you would always find out immediately that you had the problem, so this bug fix isn't going fix anything that was previously silent. </li>
</ul>

  <li>Added bitset::data() function. Suggested by 


Matthew Boelter  and Jeremy Paulding.</li>
  <li>Added const version of get_allocator to basic_string.</li>
  <li>Added basic_string::force_size(), which which unilaterally moves the string end position (mpEnd) to make the string be a given size. Useful for when the user writes  into the string via some extenal means such as C strcpy or sprintf. Note that you cannot achieve this goal via the resize() function, as resize fills in zeroes when it increases the size, as per C++ std::basic_string convention. </li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Node-based fixed_* containers now init their node buffers only once instead of twice upon container construction. This is a performance improvement.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in deque whereby it could erroneously expand its storage upon assignment to a significantly larger size than current. This could result in a crash. Discovered and reported by Nicolas Mercier.</li>
  <li>Fixed compile warning in slist for case of <font size="-1">EASTL_SLIST_SIZE_CACHE=1</font>. Reported by Nate Jones.</li>
  <li>Fixed crash bug in slist copy constructor. Reported by Nate Jones. </li>
  <li>Fixed intrusive_list::sort compiler error for case of <font size="-1">EASTL_LIST_SIZE_CACHE=1</font>.</li>

<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Modified fixed_* container copy constructors to copy the allocator name in addition to the container contents. Suggested by Jon Parise.</li>
  <li>Converted most static const integral members to be enums instead. It turns out that in Microsoft debug information is significantly larger for static const members than for enums. </li>
  <li>Removed support for <font size="-1">EASTL_VIRTUAL_ALLOCATE</font>, which was an experimental feature that went unused. This feature allowed you to subclass containers and override their allocation mechanism. This feature has been replaced by a new experimental feature called <font size="-1">EASTL_ENABLE_VIRTUAL_ALLOCATOR</font>.</li>

  <li>Added  SPU support. Submitted by Ashton Mason.</li>
  <li>Added override allocator specification to fixed_set, fixed_multiset, fixed_map, fixed_multimap. Submitted by Ben Talbot.</li>
  <li>Added<font size="-1"> EASTL_MINMAX_ENABLED</font>, which allows min/max to go away. Suggested by Ben Talbot  and Jon Lawlor.</li>
  <li>Added get_overflow_allocator/set_overflow_allocator to fixed_string. Soon to follow for other fixed containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed x64/Linux/GCC vararg bug in the string.h sprintf function under  whereby a string resize could crash. Submitted by Dave O'Neill. </li>
  <li>Fixed definition of EA_LIKELY whereby it wouldn't be used under GCC.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in bitset::count for old GCC versions (2.x). </li>
  <li>Fixed bug in string_abstract whereby not having operator +=(base_type&amp;) could cause an intented temporary to be created. Reported by Patrick Moore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated the FAQ with a new entry regarding the __STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS define and stdint.h.</li>
  <li>EASTL_LIST_PROXY_ENABLED extended to slist in addition to list. EASTL_LIST_PROXY_ENABLED disabled under VC8, since that compiler already supports a certain amount of smart container debugging. </li>
  <li>Fixed the debugger visualizer view for the list container in the FAQ. Provided by Jeremy Paulding.</li>
  <li>Did tweak to dllexport behavior (Windows platform) which allows apps to use intrusive_list without compiling an EASTL library.</li>
  <li>The assertion macro for SN compiler on PS3 was changed from __builtin_trap to __builtin_snpause. The latter is more friendly to debugging. </li>
  <li>Added printf(&quot;\32&quot;) to end of unit test under PS3 and PS2. This indicates to the SN tools that the app is done. </li>

<p><strong>Version 1.09.01 </strong> (December 5, 2007)</p>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added initial support for the SN PS3 compiler. This involved one tiny container code change and one debug assertion define change. This support likely require more extensive testing before it is known to be good, as the SN compiler for PS3 is a fairly new entity for EA. </li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed compiler warning in deque.h and recent Microsoft compilers regarding a signed/unsigned mismatch in the DoReallocSubarray function. Reported by <span id="SupportWebConversation1_lblProblemDescription" class="query_text">Samir Sinha.</span></li>
  <li>Fixed compiler warning in eastl::bitvector regarding  a difference between the declaration and the definition of the validate function. </li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>intrusive_ptr now uses intrusive_ptr_add_ref / intrusive_ptr_release calls instead of direct calls. This allows the user to easily override the refernce counting mechanism on a per-class basis. Suggested by Magnus Ryme.</li>
  <li>Made workaround for Xenon standard library header bug recently introduced by Microsoft which affected the EASTL benchmark test app. </li>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.09.00 </strong> (November 5, 2007)</p>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added additional debug validation to deque to match that of vector. </li>
  <li>Added the full() function to fixed size containers. This function efficiently tells you if all of the fixed space has been used. For fixed-size containers with overflow disabled, full() == (size() == capacity()), but it is useful because some containers execute size in O(n) instead of O(1), whereas full() executes in O(1). So far this is implemented for list, slist, and vector. Suggested by Jon Lawlor. </li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed compile error in shared_ptr on Wii/CodeWarrior/Radix. Submitted by Ben Smith.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in linked_ptr and linked_array whereby subclasses couldn't be used with parent classes. Submitted by Harvey Thompson.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Made a minor change to vector and deque to work around what appears to be code misgeneration by the Wii compiler (CodeWarrior). Code misgeneration found by Ben Smith. </li>
  <li>The heap algorithms now support aligned data types with all compilers. Previously the implementation didn't allow aligned types due to limitations in the VC++ compiler. Submitted by Jon Parise. </li>
	<li>Made bitvector closer to working. It now compiles but is only partially 
	tested and doesn't support containers other than deque.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.08.02 </strong> (September 26, 2007)</p>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug in vector::erase(first, last) that was introduced in 1.08.00. It was intended to be a minor optimization, but it wasn't checked well enough. </li>
  <li>PS2 / GCC 2.x compatibility has been reinstated. EASTL will continue to support PS2 as long as it is needed. </li>
  <li>Fixed some potential CodeWarrior compiler errors in hashtable.h regarding template using statement requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Disabled Compare validation for lower_bound, upper_bound, and equal_range. The C++ standard STL specifications for these functions don't specify that the user is required to support the functionality that the validation code requires. So we align EASTL with the STL standard. This was brought up by Avery Lee. </li>
  <li>Made EASTL_VALIDATE_INTRUSIVE_LIST be disabled by default. This is because its presence requires that intrusive_list_node be a POD, whereas normally this isn't a requirement. Thus EASTL_VALIDATE_INTRUSIVE_LIST might break some existing code when enabled. </li>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.08.00 </strong> (September 10, 2007)</p>
<p>Release Notes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feel free to try out the new string implementation (based on the abstract_string class), as we would like to make it the default in after it is sufficiently tested. This release fixes some problems with the initial version present in the previous release of this package. </li>
  <li>EASTL 1.07.00 added Compare function validation, and this may result in debug build compiler failures for the case whereby the user has made a custom compare function between two classes A and B and (incorrectly) assumed that all comparisons would only be A &lt; B and not B &lt; A. If you make a compare function between two different classes, you should be prepared that the compare could execute in either order, at least when EASTL_DEBUG is defined. This is a belated warning about this behavior. </li>
</ul>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added FAQ entry regarding hash container metrics. </li>
  <li>Added initial draft of bitvector based on work by Ryan Ingram.</li>
  <li>Added string_hash to functional.h. This is a generic hash function that could be applied to any basic_string type. </li>
  <li>Added add_signed and add_unsigned type traits. These convert any type into its signed and unsigned equivalent, respectively. </li>
  <li>Added default allocation names to fixed-size container (e.g. fixed_vector) overflow allocators in debug builds. </li>
  <li>Added ability to override default allocator definition. See, for example, <font size="-1">EASTL_VECTOR_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR</font>.</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug in allocator.h  whereby it was using eastl::allocator instead of the wrapping macro EASTLAllocatorType. The latter allows you to redefine the EASTL allocator. This bug only could affect people that are redefining the EASTL allocator type. Submitted by Sergey Klibanov.</li>
  <li>Disabled compiler warning in list::splice that would fire during list::sort when in practice there is no problem. This is not an ideal solution this problem, but the best solution probably involves revising or augmenting the list::sort and list::merge functions to be able to work on merely node pointers. This is in response to a report by Ryan Petrie.</li>
  <li>Added more <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">using</font> statements to vector, such as <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">using base_type::GetNewCapacity</font>. This fixes some compilation problems with the CodeWarrior compiler found by Michael Bagley.</li>
  <li>Fixed potential compile error in red_black_tree for the CodeWarrior compiler regarding a <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">using</font> statement of mCompare and similarly with mExtractKey in hashtable.h. </li>
  <li>Fixed bug in basic_string substr and operator+ whereby the allocator wasn't being passed to newly constructed temporary strings. Submitted by Dan Christensen and Jon Parise. </li>
  <li>Made workaround for bug in PS2 compiler (GCC 2.95) in map.h. Found by Paul Hudak  and Martin Griffiths. </li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>type traits improved to reduce symbol generation and debug info size. This work was done by Henry Goffin. </li>
  <li>EASTL_NAME_VAL macro changed from <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">#define NULL</font> to <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">#define ((const char*)NULL)</font>. Based on a suggestion by Eugenio Panero.</li>
  <li>Clarified the documentation for the allocator specification, based on a discussion with Sergey Klibanov. </li>
  <li>get_temporary_buffer modified to take const char* instead of just char* as the pName parameter. This is arguably a bug fix. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.07.00 </strong> (July 23, 2007)</p>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added priority_queue::validate(). At this point the validate function is no more than calling container::validate() and is_heap(), which are already available. This makes the priority queue consistent with other containers.</li>
  <li>Added an initial test implementation of abstract_string to the bonus directory via two files: string_abstract.h and fixed_string_abstract.h. These are intended to possibly replace string.h and fixed_string.h if it works out OK. To test these, replace the original string.h and fixed_string.h files with these. It is probably best if you don't become dependent on the unique functionality in abstract_string unless and until it gets promoted to mainline functionality. </li>
  <li>Added validate_xxx functions (e.g. validate_less()) which verify that the comparison functions are valid. Added such function validation to algorithms and containers. If you supply an invalid comparison function to some algorithms or containers you can get crashes, sometimes in rare and unexpected ways. There are some unusual cases whereby these validation functions might succeed but the comparison is still invalid, such as the case with some kinds of floating point comparisons. An EASTL_VALIDATE_COMPARE macro has been created which wraps debug testing of this validation.</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug in string sprintf for the case whereby the user is using the Microsoft _vsnprintf to do the work instead of a standards-conforming vsnprintf.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in basic_string::set_capacity whereby an increased capacity could result in an off-by-one error. </li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>Made vector::clear more efficient by directly implementing the operations instead of calling erase(begin, end). This was suggested by Jon Lawlor.</li>
  <li>Made vector::erase potentially more efficient for the case of erasing simple types (e.g. int, char, float, void*). This change isn't necessarily a win, and it may be removed in the future. </li>
  <li>Changed the internal EASTLAlloc and EASTLFree macros to support expressions as arguments instead of just individual symbols.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Version 1.06.01</strong> (June 1, 2007)</p>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added the ability to have a custom overflow allocator assigned to fixed_hash containers instead of just the default global allocator. This completes the similar functionality introduced in 1.05.00 for other fixed size containers. </li>
  <li>Added the unintialized_move function, which aids in implementing faster and simpler container reallocation for elements of type has_trivial_relocate. The typical use case is where you have vector&lt;AutoRefCount&gt; and you want to avoid a ref-count storm when reallocating the vector. This function was implemented by Ryan Ingram and reviewed by Henry Goffin. </li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Fixed Linux/GCC 4.1.1+ compiler error for set and map due to the compiler not seeing the lower_bound function in the parent class. </li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>Augmented the  benchmark to accomodate comparison with stdcxx (a.k.a Apache STL, a.k.a. RogueWave STL).</li>
  <li>The unit test now supports Win64 under Framework2/nant/eaconfig.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 1.06.00 </strong> (May 4, 2007)</p>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added bitset::find_first and find_next, plus an associated unit test.</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Fixed Linux compiler error for when using GCC with 32 bit wchar_t.</li>
  <li>Fixed CodeWarrior compiler warnings for the benchmark. </li>
  <li>Fixed CodeWarrior vararg problem in basic_string::append_sprintf. CodeWarrior va_lists are destroyed even when passed by value. So code was added   to save va_list objects between usage under CodeWarrior. </li>
  <li>Fixed DLL build for fixed-size containers. </li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>Modified the default ctor for vector, list, slist, deque, and string to not create and copy a temporary allocator. This is more efficient for the case where the user has an expensive-to-construct custom allocator. Otherwise nobody is likely to see any difference with this change. </li>
  <li> Made the default ctor for vector, list, slist, deque, string not create a temporary. This should improve performance for some cases of non-trivial custom allocators. </li>
  <li>Changed the unit test application to use an external copy of EABase and PPMalloc instead of using an internal copy of them. </li>

Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added the ability to have a custom overflow allocator assigned to fixed_string, fixed_vector, fixed_list, and fixed_slist instead of just the default global allocator. This has not yet been extended to the fixed_hash, fixed_set, and fixed_map classes.</li>
  <li>Added  sndbs and IncrediBuild entries to the masterconfig.xml to enable distributed builds.</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Fixed some compiler warnings and errors under GCC 3.4/Linux.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug under VC++/x86 in the min/max asm code that was causing an fp stack underflow (fcomp was being used to pop an entry, but it reads two items). This exception is normally masked, so execution continues but you get a ~30 clock stall. Note that this fix is in currently-disabled code.</li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>The Vsnprintf function referred to in string.h was moved into the eastl namespace in order to reduce the possibility of ambiguity. </li>
  <li>Modified the FAQ.html to fix some typographical errors. </li>
  <li>The unit test and benchmark application now uses the native PPMalloc package instead of having a private copy of it. </li>
  <li>The benchmark source code was revised to remove some compiler warnings under GCC 3.4/Linux and VC8/Windows.</li>
  <li>Simplified the build files down to a single EASTL.build file. </li>
  <li>Removed test and benchmark vcproj files in favor of simply always using .build files. </li>

Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;none&gt;</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Fixed swap / assignment operator for case whereby two hash tables of the same type but unequal allocators are used in the swap. An infinite recursion could have occurred. </li>
  <li>Fixed bug in algorithm.h with the copy algorithm whereby it was using memcpy whereas instead it theoretically needs to use memmove in order to be safe. It is not known if this bug would result in problematic behavior in practice, but a problem related to this was in fact seen with the PS3 memcpy function.</li>
  <li>Fixed compilation error in list::sort for when EASTL_LIST_SIZE_CACHE is enabled.  </li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>Converted bitset to use shift and mask operations instead of division and modulus operations. The result is that debug builds go faster, as compilers were not converting the divisions and mods to shifts and masks in debug builds. </li>

    <br>
  Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added find_as to set/multiset/map/multimap. This complements the find_as functionality previously present in hash and intrusive_hash containers. Recall that find_as is an extension function which allows for faster associative container lookups when the key type is &quot;heavy&quot;, such as a string class. This extension was implemented and submitted by Jon Parise.</li>
  <li>Added less_2 to functional.h to complement equal_to_2 and to be used with the aforementioned find_as function. </li>
  <li>Added core_allocator_adapter.h, which allows you to use an ICoreAllocator in EASTL (e.g. with a container).</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Fixed definition of eastl_ssize_t. It was mistakenly set to be the same as eastl_size_t.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in list::reset for the case where EASTL_SLIST_SIZE_CACHE is enabled (it is disabled by default). Fix submitted by Jon Lawlor.</li>
  <li>Fixed bogus  assertion failure in list::sort for the case whereby the list being sorted has an allocator member that isn't the default for that allocator type. The code executed correctly.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in rbtree::swap which could cause a crash. The bug was detected and fixed by James Grieve.</li>
  <li>Fixed a documentation bug in algorithm.h regarding an example of how to use the unique algorithm. </li>
  <li>Implemented somewhat hacky way to work around CodeWarrior's way of doing header files. Basically CodeWarrior unilaterally includes the current directory as part of the include path even if you don't specify so and even if you #include files with &lt;&gt; instead of &quot;&quot;. This means that it becomes effectively impossible for you to have any header file that is the same name as any other in the project. </li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>The list class has the GCC-specific compiler directives removed. They should no longer be necessary, as the bug which necessitated them was fixed in v1.01.00. </li>
  <li>Documentation has been modified to more precisely define allocator expectations.</li>
  <li>Made XBox 360 specific functions for a few string member search functions. Metrics showed that a memchr/memcmp-based search was faster than a compiler-generated algorithm. Note that on other platforms/compilers, this was not so. </li>
  <li>Did some minor bitset optimization of the set(size_t, bool) function. Some compilers weren't doing the optimal thing. </li>
  <li>Removed allocator swap in deque::swap, for consistency with other containers. </li>
  <li>Disabled the Win32/x86 optimized pathways for the min and max algorithms. They didn't always act optimally. </li>

    <br>
  Release Notes</p>
<ul>
  <li>This version of EASTL adds argument validation to the vector and string classes (and their variants such as fixed_vector). This may result in users getting assertion failures in these modules where they weren't previously. These assertion failures are indicating that a misuse of the given vector or string has occurred. Efforts have been made to make sure errors are not mis-reported, but please notify the EASTL maintainer if you believe a failure report to be in error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added argument validation to the vector and string classes. For example, if you use an invalid index for operator[], an assertion failure will be generated.</li>
  <li>Added a provisional radix_sort to sort_extra.h.</li>
  <li>Added a provisional  <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> insert(const Key&amp; key)</font> function to <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">map/multimap/hash_map/hash_multimap</font>. This function is like <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">vector::push_back(void)</font> in that it doesn't require a value_type but instead creates one by default in the correct place. Then you can reference the object directly from its position in the map. The advantage of this is that it avoids the creation of value_type temporaries and copy construction.</li>
</ul>

Bug Fixes

  <br>
Additions </p>
<ul>
  <li>Added definition of <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">eastl_ssize_t</font> to go with <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">eastl_size_t</font>. This is similar to the Posix/Unix convention (but not C standard) <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ssize_t</font>. </li>
  <li>Added a constructor for <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">pair</font> which takes just the first parameter but not the second. This allows for more efficient usage of <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">map</font> <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">value_type</font> creation. </li>
  <li>Added contiguous_iterator_tag to extend random_access_iterator_tag. Contiguous ranges are more than random access, they are physically contiguous. This allows for optimizations that aren't possible with random-access. For example, a deque is random-access, but it is not contiguous and thus you cannot memcpy its contents. Future optimizations in EASTL may be able to take advantage of this iterator tag.</li>
  <li>Added VS2005 support. This mostly was a matter of working around or disabling warnings generated by this compiler. </li>
  <li>Added documentation regarding VC8 autoexpand to the FAQ.</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Fixed compiler warning in ring_buffer related to a function argument called &quot;capacity&quot;. </li>
  <li>Fixed compiler warning that appeared under VC8 when warnings &quot;that are normally disabled&quot; are enabled. It turns out that VC++'s malloc.h header file generates such warnings. EASTL was modified to disable compiler warnings whenever #including malloc.h directly or indirectly. </li>
  <li>Removed incorrect <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">const</font> usage from functions in numeric.h which result in compiler errors.</li>
  <li>Fixed <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">vector_set</font>, <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">vector_multiset</font>, <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">vector_map</font>, <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">vector_multimap</font> versions of <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">insert(iterator position, const value_type&amp; value)</font>. This is the rarely-used iterator-hint version of insert. There were cases where an insertion operation could incorrectly fail for some values of a hint iterator. </li>
  <li>Fixed eastl::hashtable so that the return value of  <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">insert(iterator position, const value_type&amp; value)</font> is iterator, and not pair. There is no C++ standard related to this, but it is certainly more consistent with other associative containers if it returns iterator instead of pair. </li>
  <li>Removed a potential compiler warning in <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">insert_iterator</font> for VC++ warning C4512 (level 4). </li>

Due to the nature of the implementations, the specializations are done as non-templated functions that use value semantics instead of reference semantics. So they aren't really template specializations at all but function overrides. A significant result of this is that using <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">eastl::min&lt;float&gt;(1.f, 2f)</font> is not the same as using <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">eastl::min(1.f, 2.f)</font>, as the former specifically uses the generic templated version while the latter uses the new optimized non-templated version. So you usually want to avoid using <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">eastl::min&lt;float&gt;()</font>; in fact VC++ has a level 4 warning that will trigger if you use <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">eastl::min&lt;float&gt;()</font>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additions </p>
<ul>
    <li>Added a provisional <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">safe_ptr</font> class, which is essentially an intrusive weak pointer. It is somewhat like <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">weak_ptr</font>, with the primary difference that it uses an intrusive list to implement the weak connection instead of using a struct allocated on the heap. This has the benefit of avoiding memory allocation at the cost of operating slower.</li>
    <li>Added <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">fixed_allocator</font> and <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">fixed_allocator_with_overflow</font> in a new header file called fixed_allocator.h. These allow you to implement a fixed-size container where by the allocated memory is provided by the user dynamically instead of via a compile-time template paramter. </li>
    <li>Added specializations of <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">min</font>/<font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">min_alt</font>/<font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">max</font>/<font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">max_alt</font> for floating point types  which implement hardware-assisted branch-free operations. </li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes 
<ul>
    <li>Fixed bug in <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">bitset</font> whereby <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">bitset&lt;32&gt;::bitset(uint32_t)</font> 
        would unilaterally set the bitset to all zeroes instead of the supplied uint32_t.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in the unit test for <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">fixed_vector</font> whereby it was testing alignment incorrectly. </li>
    <li>Fixed unused parameter warning in memory.h.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">merge_sort</font> in which memory it allocated via allocate_memory wasn't constructed to the appropriate <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">value_type</font>. This would lead to a crash for cases where <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">value_type</font> is no-POD. Since <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">stable_sort</font> calls <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">merge_sort</font>, <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">stable_sort</font> is affected by this as well. </li>
    <li>Fixed bug in <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">fixed_hash</font> containers whereby a users-specified bucket count that was equal to a prime number resulted in an off-by-one. </li>
    <li>Fixed <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">is_class</font> type trait to work correctly under GCC 4. </li>
    <li>Fixed <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">bitset</font> for GCC 4 when 64 bit words are in use. Some functions such as flip() wouldn't work, due to the usage of <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">__builtin_popcountl</font> instead of <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">__builtin_popcountll</font>.</li>
    <li>Fixed compiler error that would result if you declared <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">vector&lt;short&gt; v(100, 0);</font> and didn't cast the 0 to <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">short</font>. The 0 caused a short/int ambiguity. </li>
    <li>Fixed bug in <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">fixed_string</font> whereby a newly constructed string mignt not have been 0-terminated. </li>
    <li>Added some GCC compiler barrier statements to get around inlining or pointer aliasing issues with the <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">list</font> class (particularly <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ListNodeBase</font>) with full optimization settings. I (Paul Pedriana) have looked at the code and can't immediately see any mistakes its making with respect to pointer aliasing assumptions nor inlinability. But disabling inlining, using -fno-strict-aliasing, or using these compiler barrier statements nevertheless make the problems go away. Note that the bug fix (which occurred after this change) is most likely the cause of this behaviour.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in list and slist whereby they were mistakenly using debug code in a release build instead of the intended release build code. The debug code wasn't slower or doing anything differently; however, it was breaking strict pointer aliasing rules. </li>
    <li>Fixed bug in string and hashtable with regard to pointer aliasing. This wasn't known to be causing problems but is an appropriate change anyway. </li>
</ul>
Changes 
<ul>
    <li>All algorithms now preserve reference semantics of user-supplied functors (e.g. sort Compare objects). This means you can now pass a Compare object by reference to a sort function and it will treat it as expected and use it internally as a reference and never copy it. No existing commercial STL lets you do this, though there is no good reason why not.</li>
    <li>Modified the way some containers destroy their value_types in order to get around compilation errors with VC++ when managed extensions (/clr) are enabled. This appears to be a bug in VC7, but it's not entirely clear.</li>
    <li>The <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">merge_sort_buffer</font> algorithm has been modified to include an optimization.</li>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 1.00.00</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> (Jun 30, 2006)<br>
<br>
Additions
<ul>
  <li>Added support for DLL builds via Framework2/Nant/EAConfig. </li>
  <li>Added some extra constructors and functions to fixed_string to allow it to do some operations it previously was disallowed from doing. This change was proposed and implemented by Henry Goffin and Alex Bilyk.</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
  <li>Fixed default constructor of value_types in <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">slist</font> to explicitly use the compiler-generated default constructor. In other words, we say &quot;<font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">new value_type()</font>&quot; instead of &quot;<font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">new value_type</font>&quot;. There is a subtle difference between the two for built-in types such as int. Other containers were already doing this properly and only slist is affected by this change.</li>
  <li>Removed possible generation of warning 4267. There is a bug in VC++ that causes some warnings to be erroneously reported. This change is internal protection against that VC++ bug. See the FAQ for more information regarding these warnings.</li>
  <li>Fixed by in <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">fixed_string&lt;char16_t&gt;</font> whereby the default constructor would not null-terminate the string. This bug was introduced in v0.99.00.</li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>Disabled VC++ warning C4345 for the convenience of the user when calling <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">container.push_back()</font>. This is one of those compiler warnings that isn't actually a warning but rather a message. Actually, this warning is odd in that it is telling the user that Microsoft fixed a bug in their compiler. </li>
  <li>Modified <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">min(a,b,compare)</font> and <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">min_alt(a,b,compare)</font> to reverse the comparison argument order to be the same order as <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">min(a,b)</font> and <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">min_alt(a,b)</font>. The previous version gave correct results but was syntactically different from the other version of <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">min</font> and <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">min_alt</font>. So to be consistent they have been changed to be identical syntactically. </li>
  <li>Documentation was added to the min and max algorithm implementations to precisely define that their syntax as<font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">(b &lt; a ? b : a)</font> and <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">(a &lt; b ? b : a)</font> respectively. </li>

Additions
<ul>
  <li>Added <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">min_alt</font> and 
    <font size="-1"> <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">max_alt</font></font> 
    algorithms, which are identical to <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">min</font> 
    and <font size="-1"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">max</font></font> 
    but avoid any possible conflicts with #defines of <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">min</font> 
    and <font size="-1"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">max</font></font> 
    that occur with the VC++ Windows compiler. Switched EASTL internal code to 
    use these functions instead of regular <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">min</font> 
    and <font size="-1"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">max</font></font>.</li>
</ul>
Bug Fixes
<ul>
    <li>Fixed bug in <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">fixed_string</font> default constructor whereby it was neglecting to set the first char to 
        0.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">intrusive_hash_map</font> and <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">intrusive_hash_multimap</font> 
        whereby the Equal template parameter was defaulting to using T instead of Key.'</li>
    <li>A big DEQUE_DEFAULT_SUBARRAY_SIZE was fixed. It was a minor bug that simply choose a different subarray size than intended.</li>
</ul>
Changes
<ul>
  <li>Made workaround for GCC 3.x bug in its implementation of UINT64_C.</li>
  <li>Made constructors for queue, stack, and priority_queue be broken out into two constructors without default arguments instead of one with default arguments. The former gives a little more flexilibility.</li>

Bug Fixes

<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug in <small><font face="courier new" size="-1">deque::pop_back()</font></small> 
    whereby it would call the destructor on the wrong object.</li>
  <li>Fixed bogus assert in the TestHash unit test in release builds. It was reporting 
    a failure, whereas the code was acting properly.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">binary_search_i&lt;..., 
    Compare&gt;</font> whereby it was ignoring the user-supplied compare function.</li>
  <li>Fixed problem with <font face="courier new" size="-1">__alignof</font> not 
    working in GCC for PS2; reverted to C-style alignof calculation in this case.</li>

  <li>Fixed bug in <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">list::remove_if</font> 
    whereby a cast was wrong and if you used the function it simply wouldn't compile.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">intrusive_hash_map</font> 
    and <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">intrusive_hash_multimap</font> 
    whereby they wanted you to create a hash for the value_type instead of the 
    key_type.</li>
</ul>

Changes
<ul>
  <li>Added a check for invalid alignment values in <font face="courier new" size="-1">fixed_pool::init()</font>. 
    GCC 2.x seems to mess up __alignof() in some cases.</li>
  <li>Moved some of allocator.cpp's implementation into allocator.h.</li>
  <li>Moved the median algorithm from sort.h to algorithm.h so that it is more 
    accessible for general use.</li>
  <li>Made <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">intrusive_list</font>, 
    <font size="-1"> <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">intrusive_slist</font></font>, 
    and <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">intrusive_sdlist</font> 
    have a copy constructor and operator=. These functions simply set the container 
    to be empty and ignore the copy source. These containers no longer are PODs.</li>
  <li>Removed <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">basic_string::append(size_type

Bug Fixes

<ul>

  <li>Fixed bug in <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">fixed_vector</span></small> and <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">fixed_string</span></small> whereby copy construction or <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">operator=</span></small> would do the wrong thing.</li>

  <li><small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">deque</span></small> subarray size calculation fixed to force

  <li><small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">intrusive_list::splice(iterator, this_type&amp;)</span></small>
fixed to deal with case of x being empty.</li>

  <li><small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">intrusive_hash::erase(value_type)</span></small> fixed to rectify

  <li>Modified calculation for default <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">deque</span></small> subarray size
to be a little more finely tuned.</li>

  <li>Modified <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">iterator</span></small> <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">operator==/!=</span></small> definitions to be more flexible in the presence of

<ul>

  <li>Added the <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">identical</span></small> algorithm
to&nbsp;<small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">algorithm.h</span></small>. This algorithm is like equal but
also&nbsp;tests for sequence equality as well; such a test cannot be done as efficiently otherwise.</li>

  <li>Added <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">fixed_substring</span></small>. This implements a string which
is merely a reference to a character array segment. It allocates no memory and on construction doesn't even copy
memory. It is usually used for efficiently working on a substring of another string as if that substring itself were a
string object.</li>

  <li>Added <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">numeric.h</span></small> to complete std <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">&lt;numeric&gt;</span></small>.</li>

Bug Fixes

<ul>

  <li>The <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">basic_string(CtorSprintf, allocator_type, const value_type*,
...)</span></small> constructor has been removed, as it collides with the <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">basic_string(CtorSprintf, const value_type*, ...)</span></small> constructor.</li>

  <li>Fixed a bug in BenchmarkSort.cpp which caused a crash in the benchmark test on PS3 in an optimized build. It was an
alignment problem.</li>

  <li>Fixed a bug in <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">internal/fixed_allocator.h</span></small> which
resulted in <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">fixed_string</span></small> and <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">fixed_vector</span></small> compiler errors when their <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">bEnableOverflow</span></small> template parameter was false.</li>

  <li>Added an "optimization barrier" to <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">list.h</span></small> which fixes
a code generation problem with GCC when used with -O2 or higher optimizations. This seems to be due to a bug in GCC,
but more investigation would be required to verify so.</li>

  <li>Added an initialize.xml file for NAnt / Framework 2 builds and which defines variables such as <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">package.EASTL.includedirs</span></small>.</li>

</ul>

Changes

<ul>

  <li>Removed some silly <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">explicit</span></small> declarations that somehow
got onto functions that didn't need them.</li>

  <li>Modified the <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">list</span></small> and <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">slist</span></small> implementations to allow the user to more easily view the list data in
a debugger.</li>

  <li>Revised <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">shared_ptr</span></small> in order to make it more like
Boost <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">shared_ptr</span></small> but with striving to avoid overhead to
the extent possible.</li>

  <li><small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">vector::compact</span></small> changed to be <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">vector::set_capacity</span></small> and make it more generalized in functionality.</li>
