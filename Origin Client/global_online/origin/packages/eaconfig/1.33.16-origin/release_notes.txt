EAConfig 1.33.08 Release Notes. May 03, 2011
---------------------------------------------------------------
New Features:
	* Added Initial VS2010 Support with some caveats/points.
	
      Visual Studio IDE is not very friendly for multiplatform solutions. On the first load after generation
      Visual Studio IDE used default configuration "Debug|Win32" and as result number of properties conditioned
      by configuration name are not loaded into IDE, however the build works fine. After saving *.suo file and 
      reloading solution all properties are reflected correctly in the IDE.
        
      Incredibuild support and PS3 support is currently not provided.
      
	* EXPERIMENTAL: Added new structured Structured XML layer to simplify build file input.
       
       Structured XML is described in more details here:  
             http://globaltechdocs.ea.com/Framework2:Eaconfig_Structured_Xml
             
    * EXPERIMENTAL: Added support for Platform Specific configuration packages. 
   
        Until recently all configurations were listed in a single configuration package (eaconfig) 
        and platform specific build settings were defined in the same configuration package. With 
        the rapid increase in number of different mobile platforms we are building now this model 
        is not sustainable anymore. Framework (nant) package was changed to support new model, where
        main configuration package (eaconfig) would contain generic tasks and targets and platform 
        specific settings and tasks can be delegated to separate platform configuration packages. 
        This new model is completely backwards compatible, i.e. old configuration packages are loaded
        the same way it was done before the change.
        
        For more details see: http://globaltechdocs.ea.com/Framework2:Platform_Specific_Configuration_Packages
     
Bug Fixes:

   ETFW-625 Number of fixes for XAML (WPF generation)

   ETFW-630 Fixed bug where resources files were not included when doing native nant build of a managed module.
   
   ETFW-665 Fixed error in signing C++/CLI assembly in native NAnt build
   
   ETFW-686 Added definition of dll-suffix property for pc-vc-* and pc64-vc-* configs 

   ETFW-740 Fixed bug where eaconfig would stop processing if no source files are defined for a module.
   
   ETFW-750 Add enable unmanaged debugging support for solution generation.
   
   Add target .net framework version support for solution generation.


EAConfig 1.33.08-pr1 (Pre Release) Release Notes. Jan 07, 2011
---------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:

   * Added support for Visual Studio 2010 for PC and Xenon platforms (no incredibuld support yet)
   
      Visual Studio IDE is not very friendly for multiplatform solutions. On the first load after generation
      Visual Studio IDE used default configuration "Debug|Win32" and as result number of properties conditioned
      by configuration name are not loaded into IDE, however the build works fine. After saving *.suo file and 
      reloading solution all properties are reflected correctly in the IDE.
      
      Visual Studio 2010 support in November XDK is a preview and is flaky.
   
      Incredibuild support and PS3 support will be added as sonn as Xoreax and Sony (SN-VSI) start supporting
      Visual Studio 2010.
   
   ETFW-608 Added SPUCLibrary build type
   
   ETFW-679 Target incredibuild.make.postprocess is called (if exists) after makefile generation, 
            to allow BuildWorks to hook some postprocess of generated makefiles.


   * EXPERIMENTAL: Added new structured Structured XML layer to simplify build file input.
       
       Structured XML is described in more details here:

EAConfig 1.33.04 Release Notes. Aug 19, 2010
--------------------------------------------------

New Features:

  -------   

Bug Fixes:

   ETFW-643 Solution builds can fail based on buildtype of modules in 1.33.03 eaconfig.

     
EAConfig 1.33.03 Release Notes. Aug 04, 2010
--------------------------------------------------

New Features:

  -------   Native nant builds respect restricted moduledendencies when linking depend package libraries.
  
            If package defines restricted moduledependencies: <group>.<module>.<dependent package>.<dependent group>.buildmodules
            and if dependent package Initialize.xml file exports libraries on per-module basis using filesets:            
            package.<dependent package>.<module>.libs then parent package will link only dependent modules.  
            
            If dependent package does not export libraries on per-module basis then standard fileset package.<dependent package>.libs will be linked.
            
            Note. During native nant build all modules in dependendent package are built. 
  

  ETFW-608  Added new standard buildtype SPUCLibrary 

Bug Fixes:

   ETFW-630 Fixed bug in MCPP resources (resources were not embedded in executable or Dll). 

   ETFW-628 Fixed bug in detection of circular dependencies between modules. 
   
   ETFW-625 Improved designermode support for WPF workflow  
   
   
     
EAConfig 1.33.02 Release Notes. June 22, 2010
--------------------------------------------------

New Features:

           Improved stability of XGE builds. 
           
           explicitly pass temp directories located in build folder to IB process
           (by setting TMP and TEMP environment variables for the process).
           
           Added vsimake wrapper to restart make on certain errors and <repeatexecif> task to 
           restart incredibuild on certain errors. The restart occurs when error string matches 
           one of the predefined strings. Eaconfig package and vstomaketools package come with set 
           of standard restart patterns. To change these restart patterns you can use following 
           eaconfig properties:
           
              xge.vsimake_wrapper_errpatterns
            
           Use this property to specify path to alternative file with error strings that will trigger restart of a make process for a package.
           The default file with error message strings is provided in vtomaketools package (starting with version 2.04.07):
           
                       vstomaketools\<version>\config\vsimake_wrapper_errpatterns.txt
           
            incredibuild.xge.repeatpattern - use this property to specify list of error messages that should trigger restart of Incredibuild XGE
            incredibuild.xgConsole.repeatpattern - use this property to specify list of error messages that should trigger restart of Incredibuild Console
            
            THe default value of these properties set in eaconfig is: "Timed out waiting for Build System process to initialize."
           
           
           Other XGE stability improvement changes are in:
           
           * vstomaketools 2.04.07 :   vstomaketools now disables RestartOnLocal in profile.xml file.
                                       cl_dep_wrapper can handle paths longer that 260 characters.

           * nantToVSTools-3.17.07 : Embedding location of PS3 tools into generated projects instead of using defaults. 
                                     Using librarian from PS3SDK instead of SNVSI librarian.
                                     
ETFW-607 Added abbility to set dll-suffix global property for xenon/ps3 based on the config-system:

               dll-suffix.${config-system}


ETFW-594 WPF. Added support for resouce files that aren't embedded.

          Non embedded resources in C# projects can be defined using fileset: 
          
                      <groupname>.resourcefiles.notembed
                      
          To control whether to link or not non embedded resources use property:
          
                    csproj.link.resourcefiles.nonembed 
                    
          Default value is true.
          

ETFW-601  The fix in global properties propagation for solution generation may cause the need to 
          change build scrits that exploited the the bug.

          Added property "eaconfig.use-old-sln-globals" to revert to the old way of handling globals.
          
          Details on global property propagation fix:
          
          Fixed bug related to configuration-specific default values of global properties in solution generation.
          When creating multiconfiguration solution, global properties from the first configuration are propagated
          to other configs. These global properties were NOT readonly, but still existed. This bug was fixed and behavior
          is now identical to native build.
          
          
ETFW-614  incredibuild target. PC/Xenon XGE builds:
           * When generating pdb per source file (incredilink) use eaconfog property 
           
                       vstomake.pdb-to-lib = true / false   (DEFAULT: false)
                       
             to redirrect output to directory spefified by 
               1) "ProgramDataBaseFileName" 
               2) if above is not defined, then PrimaryOutput directory (or "ImportLibrary" for DLLs).
               
           * When incremental linking is enabled and one has UseLibraryDependencyInputs set, for the dependent
             projects whose .obj files are used as linker inputs use eaconfig property 
                    
                    vstomake.skip-create-lib = true/false (DEFAULT: false)
                    
             to skip creation of libraries.

          
Bug Fixes:

       * Fixed broken -DEF and -BASE support.
       * Ensure that directory specified in the SNTemp path (-td option) always exists.
       * Quoted input and output arguments that are passed to imagexex so that paths/files that contain spaces are supported.

EAConfig 1.33.01 Release Notes. May 28, 2010
--------------------------------------------------

New Features:

   ETFW-554 Eaconfig properties
                  <group>.[module].max-bulkbuild-size
                  eaconfig.max-bulkbuild-size
            Can be used to specify maximal number of lines in the generated bulkbuild file. If
            any of above properties is specified bulkbuild files will be automatically split so that
            none of the files has more lines in it than specified by max-bulkbuild-size property.
            
            eaconfig.max-bulkbuild-size global property will be applied to all packages in the build
            <group>.[module].max-bulkbuild-size will be applied only to the specified module/package.
            
            If both properties are defined package specific setting <group>.[module].max-bulkbuild-size
            takes presedence over global setting.
            
   ETFW-524 Added new modes to control warning supression globally. Property
             eaconfig.default_warning_suppression now accepts four values" 'on', 'off', 'strict', 'custom'
             
             for details see: http://globaltechdocs.ea.com/Framework2:Warning_Suppression
             
   ETFW-534   Added new builtype "CDynamicLibrary" to build DLLs from of C language source files.
            
Bug Fixes:

   ETFW-565  Fixed C# csproj generator to merge identical files, references and other data under 
             <ItemGroup> element rather than create separate <ItemGroup> for each config.
             Before the fix VisualStudio IDE was creating a lot a false warnings while loading projects that
             contained same data under multiple <ItemGroup> elements that differ only by configuration condition.
             
   ETFW-544  Visual  Studio build for Utility buildtype project was failing if it contained source files.
             After the fix all source files in Utility project are marked as non buildable in the generated
             Visual Studio project
         
   ETFW-564  Fixed bug introduced in eaconfig-1.33.00 where  eaconfig.usemultithreadeddynamiclib stopped working.
   
   ETFW-568  Fixed bug introduced in eaconfig-1.33.00 where make_fself command line was not properly formed.
   
   ETFW-573 Fixed bug introduced in eaconfig-1.33.00 where TaskUtil.ExecuteScriptTask was not properly initializing 
            default parameter values and was not caling OnUserTaskStarted correctly.
            
   ETFW-268 Fixed bug related to configuration-specific default values of global properties in solution generation.
            When creating multiconfiguration solution, global properties from the first configuration are propagated
            to other configs. These global properties were NOT readonly, but still existed. This bug was fixed and behavior
            is now identical to native build.
            
            NOTE. The fix will properly work only with Framework-2.15.05 or later. 
                  With older versions of Framework behavior is unchanged.

     
EAConfig 1.33.00 Release Notes. April 29, 2010
--------------------------------------------------

New Features:

   Significant optimization of eaconfig. Many of the eaconfig scripts are rewritten as C# tasks.
   Loading of eaconfig is much faster. Nant overhead reduced by a factor of 4. 
   Solution generation runs 3-4 times faster (speed can be affected by custom steps like codegeneration).
   Nant overhead in the native nant builds is reduced by a factor of 3.

   ETFW-329 New types of dependencies added to eaconfig:
   
            interfacedependencies - same as usedependencies, but does not link libraries.
            linkdependencies - same as builddependencies, but does not add include directories.

   ETFW-490 Added run-fast, test-run-fast, example-run-fast, and tool-run-fast targets (same as the run, test-run, example-run,
            and tool-run targets with the exception that these targets don't trigger a build before doing the run).

   ETFW-447 Added support to allow user to define base address and definition file for PC and Xenon build.  Use the following
            properties to specify the information:
              ${groupname}.definition-file
              ${groupname}.definition-file.${config-system}       (this overrides the above)
              ${groupname}.base-address
              ${groupname}.base-address.${config-system}          (this overrides the above)
            (Note that for this feature to work in solution build, you will need to use nantToVSTools 3.17.05 or later).

   ETFW-469 Added support for a new buildtype call "MakeStyle".  Use the following properties to specify the make style tasks:
              ${groupname}.MakeBuildCommand
              ${groupname}.MakeCleanCommand
              ${groupname}.MakeRebuildCommand                     (this one is only used by nantToVSTools for vcproj creation)
            (Note that for this feature to work in solution build, you will need to use nantToVSTools 3.17.05 or later).
            
   ----     Added "incredibuild.xge.useincredilink" property to facilitate incredilink functionality for PC an Xenon builds.          
   
            When "incredibuild.xge.useincredilink" is set to "true" eaconfig code will set following options in all buildsets:
            
               incrementallinking=on
               uselibrarydependencyinputs=on
               
            uselibrarydependencyinputs forces to use object files from dependent packages instead of library files.

Bug Fixes:

   ETFW-127 Removed duplicate include dirs specification during build.

   ETFW-141 Added a caution message in Visual Studio build for PS3 config if Visual Studio parallel build is setting is on.

   ETFW-155 Added warning message if a package being listed in builddependencies is a FW1 package (or missing Manifest.xml file 
            and thereby treating the package as a FW1 package).

   ETFW-526 Updated lint.includedirs property to allow user adding extra include path for pclint


     
EAConfig 1.32.07 Release Notes. April 14, 2010
--------------------------------------------------

Bug Fixes:

   -        Fixed path separator for builds on unix
   -        Added default option -Wl,-Map,"%linkoutputmapname%" for “unix” platform builds 


EAConfig 1.32.06 Release Notes. March 02, 2010
--------------------------------------------------
New Features:

   ETFW-383 Added support for property vsimake.tibsqlpp to allow user to pass in /tibslpp commandline option to vstomakefile.exe.
            Also added properties incredibuild.xgemakefile and incredibuild.xgmake to allow user to separate out make file 
            creation and running the xgConsole by setting these properties to true or false.

Bug Fixes:

   -        Fixed issue with Incredibuild/vsimake not building on Windows 7 due to Windows 7's GetShortPathName bug.

   ETFW-383 Updated an error message when a package fails to do a dependent on another package.

   ETFW-445 ps3-sn build now uses -td switch to automatically specify a temp directory for the SN compiler.  Previously, we
            rely on SN Compiler to find a temp directory.  However, we found that on Windows 7 machine, the functionality is
            somewhat broken and would lead to build error on some machines.

   ETFW-454 Removed the -nostdinc compiler switch for ps3-sn build.  (For your information, this compiler switch means: do not
            search the standard system directories for header files.  Only the directories specified with -I options are 
            searched.  The new ps3sdk 310 SN compiler relies on user not using this switch in order to suppress warnings coming
            from SDK headers.)

   ETFW-467 Previously, if you specified COM assemblies, build script assumes copylocal property was provided.  This is now fixed.

   ETFW-468 Building C# projects using VS2008 will now automatically add System.Core.dll to the reference list.

   ETFW-475 Fixed inconsistency between native nant build and solution build regarding COM assembly integration.  Previously in 
            native nant build, if a build file specified COM assemblies, a .Net interpo reference was automatically created and
            this interop reference was used during the build instead of the COM assembly itself (therefore removed to requirement
            to pre-register the COM reference before doing a build).  However, this .Net interop reference wasn't used during
            solution build setup.  This is now corrected.


EAConfig 1.32.05 Release Notes. Feb 01, 2010
--------------------------------------------------
New Features:

   ETFW-425 added tool-dll configs:
              pc-vc-dll-tool-dev-*
              pc64-vc-dll-tool-dev-*

   ETFW-424 Changed MergeOptionset to override binary option values like on/off instead of appending 
            their values
             
   ETFW-417 Added a way to configure dll suffix for PS3 builds using property "dll-suffix".
            Default value in eaconfig is <property name="dll-suffix" value=".prx"/>
             
   ETFW-126 Added new property "eaconfig.default_warning_suppression = on/off" to allow user 
            to quickly turn off the default warning suppression provided by eaconfig.
            Default value is 'on'

Bug Fixes:

   ETFW-435 Fixed bug where "package.<package>.debuglevel" property was not working properly 
            with debugflags set to 'custom'
            
   ETFW-419 Fixed test-run target for Xenon. Fixed an error in xex path.
   
   ETFW-255 Fixed copylocal functionality for C# and MCPP projects.  Behaviour of this functionality is now consistent between
            solution build and native nant build.  Note that this property will not do anything for unmanaged DLLs!
   
   ETFW-137 Order of build modules in runtime.buildmodules is automatically determined. Removed need for user to specify 
            modules in any particular order.
            
   ETFW-401 REWORK: use actual buildtype instead of base buildtype when retrieving linkoutput name.

            Some game teams' custom config has re-defined linkoutputname to contain extra info such as 
            ${config-type} causing the test-run target to fail.  Updated the test-run to attempt to 
            preserve those extra info from the linkoutputname.

            Also updated to take into account of custom ${groupname}.outputdir information when executing test-run.


EAConfig 1.32.04 Release Notes. Jan 11, 2010
--------------------------------------------------
New Features:

   ETFW-352 Added eaconfig property 'incredibuild.xgConsole.custom_options' to define extra command
            line parameters for Incredibuild XGE invocation

Bug Fixes:

   ETFW-422 Fixed XGE command line parameters to work with Incredibuld 3.50 or higher.
   ETFW-380 Fixed test-run target to use linoutputname instead of hardcoded path to the 
            executable file.
   ETFW-418 Updated Framework2 online doccumentation

     (c) Electronic Arts. All Rights Reserved.
     
EAConfig 1.32.03-unix Release Notes. Dec , 2009
--------------------------------------------------

New Features:

  Added support to build on Unix?MAC OSX platforms.

     (c) Electronic Arts. All Rights Reserved.
     
EAConfig 1.32.02 Release Notes. Sept 28, 2009
--------------------------------------------------
New Features:

   ETFW-237  Added support for precompiled headers in native nant builds, Vusual Studio builds, Incredibuild XGE builds. 
   
             Support for precompiled headers in builds requires Framework-2.15.00 or higher.   
             VisualStudio builds with precompiled headers require nantToVSTools-3.17.02 or higher.
             Incredibuild XGE builds with precompiled headers require vstomaketools-2.04.01 or higher.
           
             Supported platforms/compilers: pc-vc-*, pc64-vc-*, xenon-vc-*, ps3-sn-*, rev-mw-*.
             Precompiled headers for gcc compiler currently not supported.

   ETFW-261  Added new property eaconfig.usemultithreadeddynamiclib, when set to true forces use of multithreaded dynamic lib
             for pc and pc64 platforms. If this property is declared as global, setting will affect all packages in the build.
             
             to overwrite this global setting in a particular package use property "package.usemultithreadeddynamiclib". This property 
             must be defined before <package> element in the package build file to have any effect. 
             Do not declare "package.usemultithreadeddynamiclib" as global in masterconfig file, for global setting always use
             "eaconfig.usemultithreadeddynamiclib" property.
             
   ETFW-269  Added 'incredibuildall' targets similar to 'buildall':
                incredibuildall
                incredibuild-example-all
                incredibuild-test-all
                incredibuild-tool-all
                
             These targets behave exactly as buildall targets, but build is performed via incredibuild.
                          
   ETFW-328  Added support for additional manifest files in the Manifest Tool
             Following filesets can be used to define "Additional Manifest Files" and 
             "Input Resource Manifests"     to the ManifestTolls in generated vcproj:
            
                 ${groupname}.vcproj.additional-manifest-files
                 ${groupname}.vcproj.additional-manifest-files.${config-system}
                 
                 ${groupname}.vcproj.input-resource-manifests
                 ${groupname}.vcproj.input-resource-manifests.${config-system}
                 
    ETFW-323  Added abbility to build a specific project in the VisualStudio sln using 
              "visualstudio", "incredibuild", or "distributed-build" targets.

              To build a single module (Visual Studio project) define property
              
              property name="eaconfig.build-one-module" value="<VS project name>"/>
              
              value of this property should be equal to a module name (or VS project name, 
              which equals to the module name in autogenerated solutions).
              
    ETFW-284  Added a global way to control /MP option for VisualStudio builds.
	
	          If property "eaconfig.build-MP" is defined (should be global to affect all 
	          generated VS projects), compiler option /MP${eaconfig.build-MP} is added.
	
	          Value of ${eaconfig.build-MP} can be equal to desired number of threads, 
	          or it can be empty. In latter case compiler autodecets number of threads.

Changes:

    ETFW-293 Removed direct detection of Platform SDK folders and DotNet folders from VisualStudio and eaconfig.
             WindowsSDK package is now used to retrieve WindowsSDK(former Platform SDK) and DotNet folders and libraries.               
             Executing dependency on DotNet (DotNetSDK) is now deferred untill it is really needed for the build. 

    ETFW-182 Xenon DLL output file extensions are now defined by eaconfig properties as:
    
                 <property name="temp-dll-suffix"   value=".dll" unless="@{PropertyExists('temp-dll-suffix')}"/>
                 <property name="dll-suffix"        value=".xex.dll" unless="@{PropertyExists('dll-suffix')}"/>/>

             To change extensions define these properties in your global masterconfig section.

    ETFW-115 Framework 2 should use response files by default on the Wii
             Now default eaconfig setting is to use response file for CC compiler on Wii.  
             
    ETFW-291 Added pc64 configs to the ToolbuildConfig task.


Bug Fixes:

    ETFW-295: PS3 platform builds are using some of the libraries with exceptions and rtti enabled 
             (from folder 'cell\target\ppu\lib\' instead of  'cell\ppu\lib\fno-exceptions\fno-rtti\')
              even if the build has exceptions and rtti disabled.
              
              The issue is fixed. Fix involves changes in both eaconfig and ps3sdk.
              
    ETFW-246  Fixed bug where PRX stub lib and verlog text file not moved into build lib directory in ps3-sn-* configs. 
    
    ETFW-216  Fixed incorrect RTTI setting for SNC : "-Xc=rtti" now replaced with "-Xc+=rtti"
    
    ETFW-217  Enabled SNC linker options with exceptions, that were missing in eaconfig. 
    
    ETFW-245  Added '-in:' option to the xenon DLL imagebuilder command line 
    
    ETFW-277  Fixed bug where debugflags=on option not being passed to solution for C# project 
    
    ETFW-321  Conflicting optimization settings for ps3-sn (speed or size)
              In eaconfig cc setting -O2 -Os first option is ignored by compiler. Removed it to avoid confusion.
              
    ETFW-273  Fixed bug where rev.mw.sdata and rev.mw.sdata2 global properties set in materconfig were not respected, 
              and were set to default values (0) specified in eaconfig.


EAConfig 1.32.01 Release Notes. July 20, 2009
--------------------------------------------------

Bug Fixes:

    ETFW-227: Debugging PS3 .selfs from VisualStudio
              The direct self generation broke the ability to debug the generated .self files from within
              Visual Studio. This has been fixed.
     
     EAConfig 1.32.00 Release Notes. July 17, 2009
--------------------------------------------------

New Features:

    ETFW-128 Added support for generation of Wii Visual Studio Solutions.  
             Requires nanttovstools-2.17.00
           
    ETFW-170 Added direct self generation for using sn linker (ps3-sn configs) instead
             of using postbuild makefself call.
      
    ETFW-153 Added property 'incredibuild.avoid_local' to control Incredibuild AvoidLocal Incredibuild switch:
     
             incredibuild.avoid_local=true  ->  XGE command line:  "/AvoidLocal=On"
             incredibuild.avoid_local=false  ->  XGE command line:  "/AvoidLocal=Off"
             
             If incredibuild.avoid_local undefined or any other  than true/false value XGE command line
             does not contain AvoidLocal switch. In this case XGE will use local agent configuration.

Changes:

    ETFW-172 Following input from Jeff Skelton changed SN compiler flags:
    
             Added flags:
                  -Xc-=rtti
                  -Xc-=exceptions
    
    ETFW-171 Added -Xquit=1 (warnings as errors) flag for PS3 SN config 
    
    ETFW-220 eaconfig-1.32.00 requires nantToVSTools-3.17.00 or newer
           
Bug Fixes:

    ETFW-173 Fixed SPU command line in SN configurations. SPU compiler was passed SN flags
             instead of GCC flags
             
    ETFW-184 Fixed bug where SN configurations do not generate map file. 
             
    ETFW-55  Fixed failure in slnruntime target for pc-vc-tool- configs for projects that contain
             C# modules.      
             
             NOTE! Solution generation will exclude pc-vc-tool configurations when list of input configs
             package.configs contain mix of pc-vc-tool- and other configs.
             
             Tool and other configs supposed to be used in separate solutions.
             
    ETFW-222 Fixed a bug in 64-bit support detection
             This issue only occured if the nantToVSTools versions older than 3.11.00 were being used 
             with eaconfig versions 1.26.00 and newer
     
     EAConfig 1.31.01 Release Notes. June 25, 2009
--------------------------------------------------

Path release addresses removal of xaudio libraries in June 2009 XDK

    34227: xaudio lib was retired in Xenonsdk 9328. Remove xaudio from standard set of libraries in xenon-* configurations.
    
     
     EAConfig 1.31.00 Release Notes. May 16, 2009
--------------------------------------------------

NOTE. New solution generation related features require nantToVSTools-3.16.00. 

New Features:

    30254: Add run targets for all build groups. In addition to test-run added run, example-run, tool-run targets.
    
    32577: Allow user to specify the specific .lnt file
    
    32872: Extended support for Xbox360 Deployment Files
    
    32839: Added new task "CallTargetIfOutOfDate" to provide custom dependency checking 
    
    32922: Added support for excludedbuildfiles in C# projects
    
    32577: Allow user to specify the specific lint options .lnt file
    
    33256: Added "profile" configurations for all platforms.
    
    33375: Added ‘platform-ptrsize’ and ‘platform-wordsize’ properties for 32 and 64 bit configs
    
    33560: Added property to control enabling/disabling strict aliasing.
    
    33705: Added property "incredibuild.verbose" = true/false. Default false.
    
           incredibuild.verbose = false results in following flags:
           
                 vstomakefile.exe  /quiet:true . . .
                 vsimake.exe       --no-print-directory . . .
                 
           incredibuild.verbose = true: 
           
                 vstomakefile.exe  /quiet:false . . .
                 vsimake.exe       . . .
           
    33892: Added control for LTCG options to pc-vc-* configs. Before it was enabled only for xenon-vc-*.
           
Bug Fixes:

    32050: Use the <SubType> value in the existing generated project file as hint in the coming C# project generation.
    
    32534: Fixed typo in eaconfig which was preventing Incredibuild XGE mode on PC platforms even when 
           incredibuild.usexge was set to true.
           
    32553: Fixed build problem related to the order of values in package.configs compared to the config value.
    
    32681: Do not use -opt:ref in MCPP builds it strips symbols needed by C# wrappers. 
    
    32918: Fixed bug in eaconfig code handling multiple bulkbuild filesets in Visual Studio solution generation targets. 
    
    32969: Several conditional expressions in eaconfig had || instead of 'or' operators. 
           As result these expressions were not evaluated correctly
           
    33170: config specific properties are ignored in sln generation
           
    33179: Target package task does not properly define base dir of a non-rooted path for the FileSet <excludes> element.
    
    33207: During Visual Studio solution generation .csproj are being over written even if there are no changes
           which causes a build because the timestamp has changed.
           
    33274: Removed full path to .Net assemblies in several places in eaconfig. Since .Net 3.5 has it's
           assemblies in different directories specifying full path to .Net folder leads to errors.
           
    33397: When package has no modules and C# code in runtime and non-runtime (test, example) groups, 
           generated projects overwrite each-other
           
    33453: Changed CodeWarrior debug flags from using dwarf-1 to using dwarf-2
    
    33648: NDEBUG define in opt configurations should is now set for all platforms, not only VC. 
    
    33681: Fixed bug where debug flags were not propagated to CSC task when these flags were defined in
           custom  Buildtypes. 
           
    33774: Fixed bug where VS solution generation is failing if some source or resource files are missing at
           solution generation time.
           
    33868: Fixed following: the <group>.<module>.copylocal property doesn't doing any copying for 
           test/example/tool groups in nant build
                             
Known Issues:

    32508: When  DotNet 3.5 in combination with 64 bit PC configuration is used failure may occur while building
           resource files using rc.exe:
            
               LINK : fatal error LNK1158: cannot run 'cvtres.exe'

           it looks like rc.exe tries to find cvtres.exe in the DotNet SDK directory, but .Net3.5 does not contain 
           this file. Adding known locations of  cvtres.exe to the PATH environment variable does not fix the problem.
           It seems that the only way is to copy cvtres.exe to the location where rc.exe expects it.
           
     33873: In native nant builds order in which CPP files are built is undefined which may lead
            to build errors. Problem will be solved in next release of Framework package.
                 
            VS Solution builds work correctly with precompiled headers. 
           
Details:

    30254: Add run targets for all build groups. In addition to test-run added run, example-run, tool-run targets.

           Run targets wil execute application on a target platform. Following properties can be used:
           
           ${group}.${module}.run.args
           ${group}.${module}.run.workingdir
           ${group}.${module}.run.homedir
           package.run.console
           
           For more details see "http://globaltechdocs.ea.com/Framework2:Eaconfig_Run_Targets"
           
    32050 Use the <SubType> value in the existing generated project file as hint in the coming C# project generation.
    
           VisualStudio intellisence may change value of <SubType> element in .csproj file. Before this fix generated 
           project was overwriting changed file. Now corresponding <SubType> values are imported from the previously 
           generated project. 
           
           NOTE. This import works for unchanged projects. Any major changes will force overrriding of existing file.
           
           
    32553: Fixed build problem related to the order of values in package.configs compared to the config value.            
    
           When configuration specified by ${config} property was not listed first in $package.configs}:
           
           -D:config=pc-vc-dll-dev-opt -D:package.configs="pc-vc-dll-dev-debug pc-vc-dll-dev-opt"  
           
           it could lead to errors "Failed to evaluate  'package.<name>.frameworkversion'" during project
           generation and building solution.   
           
    32577: Allow user to specify the specific .lnt file
    
           By default lint options file name equal to <module name>.lnt, and it is expected to be located 
           in the directory: ${package.dir}/config/pclint

           If property "package.lint-optionfile" or "package.<module name>.lint-optionfileis" is specified 
           its value will be used.

           1. package.<module name>.lint-optionfileis takes precedence over package.lint-optionfile
           2. If custom value for the lint-optionfile contains only file name the default directory 
              will be preserved. If custom value contains path, this path will be used to determine 
              file directory.
              
    32681: Do not use -opt:ref in MCPP builds it strips symbols needed by C# wrappers. 
    
           MCPP assemblies (DLLs) are built without -opt:ref option now.
           
    32839: Added new task "CallTargetIfOutOfDate" to provide custom dependency checking.
    
           Task has following parameters:
           
           "InputFileset"  [required]   - Name of file set containing input files
           "OutputFileset"              - Name of fileset containg output files.
                                          Output files are produced by target specified in "TargetName" 
           "DummyOutputFile"            - Task will create file with given name before calling
                                          target  "TargetName". Used as output in case target itself does
                                           not produce any 
           "DependencyFile" [required]  - name of a file to store list of input files. 
           "TargetName" [required]      - name of nant target to excecute.
           
           
           This task executes target "TargetName" if:
           
           1. Any of output files specified in "OutputFileset" or "DummyOutputFile" is missing
           2. "DependencyFile" is missing (first run after clean)
           3. List of input files stored in "DependencyFile" differs from the current list of input files.
           4. Any of the output files specified in "OutputFileset" or "DummyOutputFile" is older than the 
              newest of input files.
              
           Otherwise target "TargetName" is not executed.  

    32872: Extended support for Xbox360 Deployment Files
           You can now use the property <group>.<module>.deploymentfiles to 
           specify the set of files that are to be deployed to the console 
           during the Visual Studio build.
           Use the following syntax to specify your deployment files:
             <property name="test.${testname}.deploymentfiles">
                $(RemoteRoot)=${package.configbindir}\test
                $(RemoteRoot)=${package.dir}/data/xenon/updir
                data=${package.dir}/data/xenon
             </property>   

           In this example the contents of '${package.configbindir}/test' and 
           '${package.dir}/data/xenon/updir' will be copied to the default 
           remote root and the contents of '${package.dir}/data/xenon' will be
           copied to the 'data' subdirectory of the remote root.

           NOTE: $(RemoteRoot) is a Visual Studio property and NOT a nant property (no curly brackets).
           
    32918: Fixed bug in eaconfig code handling multiple bulkbuild filesets in Visual Studio solution generation targets. 
           When two different input bulkbuild filesets have include and exclude statements containing same files 
           the list of original source files in generated solution was missing those files.
           
           Example:
           
               <fileset name="runtime.TestLib.bulkbuild.part1.sourcefiles">
                  <includes fromfileset="package.DummyLib.main"/>
                  <includes name="source/TestLib/**/*.cpp"/>
                  <excludes name="source/TestLib/TestExcludeInclude/Folder1/*.cpp"/>
                  <excludes name="source/TestLib/TestExcludeInclude/Folder2/*.cpp"/>
               </fileset>

               <fileset name="runtime.TestLib.bulkbuild.part2.sourcefiles">
                  <includes name="source/TestLib/TestExcludeInclude/Folder1/*.cpp"/>
                  <includes name="source/TestLib/TestExcludeInclude/Folder2/*.cpp"/>
               </fileset>

              <property name="runtime.TestLib.bulkbuild.filesets" value="part1 part2"/>
              
         Before the fix bulkbuild files were generated correctly and solution builds fine, 
         but VS project would miss files from "TestExcludeInclude" folder.
           
    32922: Added support for excludedbuildfiles in C# projects
           Files in the filesets named 
    
                 <group>.<module name>.csproj.excludedbuildfiles
           and 
                 <group>.<module name>.csproj.excludedbuildfiles.${config-system}
                 
           will be added to csproj file as non buildable (Action = Content) files.
           <group> is one of runtime, test, or example groups.
           <module name> is the name of build module. If package does not have build modules <module name> should be skipped.
           
           Similar feature exists for vcproj files:
                 group.<module name>.vcproj.excludedbuildfiles
                 group.<module>.vcproj.excludedbuildfiles.${config-system}
           
    32577: Allow user to specify the specific lint options .lnt file
    
           By deafault lint options file name equal to <module name>.lnt, and it is expected to be located 
           in the directory: ${package.dir}/config/pclint
    
           If property "package.lint-optionfile" or "package.<module name>.lint-optionfileis" is specified 
           its value will be used.
           
           1. package.<module name>.lint-optionfileis takes precedence over package.lint-optionfile
           2. If custom value for the lint-optionfile contains only file name the default directory will be preserved. 
              If custom value contains path, this path will be used to determine file directory.
              
     33170: config specific properties are ignored in sln generation
     
            When generating multiconfig VS solution global properties were created as readonly for first
            configuration and couln't be changed even by top level package for other configurations.
            This was fixed. Global property passed to dependents as readonly, but it can be changed when multiconfig
            targets loop through configurations.
              
     33179: Target package does not properly define base dir of a non-rooted path for the FileSet <excludes> element.
     
            After the fix basedir is set to ${package.dir} for a noon-rooted file pathj specified in the <excludes> element
            
     33207: During Visual Studio solution generation .csproj are being over written even if there are no changes.
     
            csproj files are not updated if there is no change. 
           
            NOTE: This does not apply to single-config solution generation
            
            NOTE2: csproj is always rebuilt even with zero change when response file is referenced in the project file.
                   response files for csproj is created from content of group.<module>.csc-args property
                   (see http://globaltechdocs.ea.com/Framework2:Eaconfig_Properties_And_Filesets#Common_Properties).
                   
                   Avoid to define csc-args, try to use other properties like *.defines, *.warningsuppression, etc. if possible.
            
    33256: Added "profile" configurations for all platforms. List of added configurations:   
    
                cyg-gcc-dev-profile
                ds-mw-dev-profile
                pc-gcc-dev-profile
                pc-vc-dev-profile
                pc-vc-dll-dev-profile
                pc-vc-tool-dev-profile
                pc64-vc-dev-profile
                pc64-vc-dll-dev-profile
                pc64-vc-tool-dev-profile
                ps3-gcc-dev-profile
                ps3-sn-dev-profile
                psp-sn-dev-profile
                rev-mw-dev-profile
    
           Most of these configurations do not differ from opt configurations and added for consistency.        
           
    33375: Added ‘platform-ptrsize’ and ‘platform-wordsize’ properties for 32 and 64 bit configs.
    
           For configurations with pc64 platform:
              platform-ptrsize = 64bit
              platform-wordsize = 32bit
  
           For all other configurations:
              platform-ptrsize = 32bit
              platform-wordsize = 32bit
              
    33560: Added property to control enabling/disabling strict aliasing on PS3.     
    
           Added option to the buildsettings option sets:
            
           <option name="enable.strict.aliasing" value="off" />

          and property: eaconfig.enable.strict.aliasing

          When option option enable.strict.aliasing is set to 'on' in a package custom build set
          it overrides eaconfig.enable.strict.aliasing property value.         
          
          Property eaconfig.enable.strict.aliasing must be declared as global to apply to all packages.
          
          Mapping to compiler options:
          
          GCC:
              eaconfig.enable.strict.aliasing = true   -> -fstrict-aliasing
              eaconfig.enable.strict.aliasing = false  -> -fno-strict-aliasing              
          SN:
              eaconfig.enable.strict.aliasing = true   -> -Xrelaxalias=2 ( is roughly equivalent to GCC's -fstrict-aliasing)
              eaconfig.enable.strict.aliasing = false  -> -Xrelaxalias=0 (is equivalent to GCC's -fno-strict-aliasing
)
              
          
    33681: Fixed bug where debug flags were not propagated to CSC task when these flags were defined in
           custom  Buildtypes. 
           
           For example, adding debug flag in a custom Buildtype was not working in optimized configurations
           before this fix.
           
    33705: Added --no-print-directory param to the vsimake.exe call in incredibuild target.           
   
           By default parameter '--no-print-directory' is specified for vsimake.exe call.

           To remove this parameter and allow for more output from vsimake.exe define property:
          
              "incredibuild.verbose=true"
              
    33774: Fixed bug where VS solution generation is failing if some source or resource files are missing at
           solution generation time.
           
           Source files included in Visual Studio solution can be automatically generated, for example,
           using "Custom  Build Steps". In this case files are missing at generation step. Eaconfig shouldn't
           fail generation in such cases.
           
           NOTE. When specifying in the package build script files that are initially missing
                 don't forget to add "asis" attribute, for example:
                 
                <fileset name="runtime.MyModule.sourcefiles">
                    <includes name="${package.dir}\source\GenerateLaterFile1.cpp" asis="true"/>
                    <includes name="${package.dir}\source\GenerateLaterFile2.cpp" asis="true"/>
                </fileset>
                
    33892: Added control for LTCG options to pc-vc-* configs. Before it was enabled only for xenon-vc-*.                
    
           There are several ltcg linker options in build settings option set:
           
              optimization.ltcg = "on", "off"       - > use ltcg or not
              optimization.ltcg.mode= "normal"      -> linker option: -LTCG
              optimization.ltcg.mode= "instrument"  -> linker option: -LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT
              optimization.ltcg.mode= "optimize"    -> linker option: -LTCG:PGOPTIMIZE
              optimization.ltcg.mode= "update"      -> linker option: -LTCG:PGUPDATE
                      
           By default ltcg is on (mode="normal") for Xenon optimized configurations
           
           Profile guided optimization requires several different steps. You can't just link optimized mode:

               1. Buiuld app using /ltcg:instrument -> will create *.pdg file
               2. Train Instrumented code.          -> will create *.pdc file
               3. Build with ltcg:optimize
            
            See details: http://www.microsoft.com/indonesia/msdn/profileguidedoptimization.aspx    
                                
EAConfig 1.30.02 Release Notes. Feb 3, 2009
---------------------------------------------

Changes:

           Internal changes required by EASharp-0.70.00 or higher. 
           NOTE! This version of eaconfig will not work properly with older releases of EASharp.

     
     
     
EAConfig 1.30.01 Release Notes. Jan 30, 2009
---------------------------------------------

New Features:

    32221: Added support for building PC and Xenon configurations using the Incredibuild Xoreax Grid Engine interface.
           Use the global property "incredibuild.usexge" to control whether Incredibuild will use the generated VisualStudio
           solution or use a makefile and the XGE interface when executing distributedbuild or incredibuild targets 
            
           "incredibuild.usexge"="true" will also force the distributedbuild target to use the Incredibuild XGE 
           instead of sndbs for PS3 platform.
            
           vstomaketools-2.01.00 or higher is required for building Xenon and PC using XGE.
     

EAConfig 1.30.00 Release Notes. 
---------------------------------------------

New Features:
    31342: Added abbility to manually specify the toolchain when using incredibuild on PS3
           incredibuild.toolchain property can be set to one of the following values: 'gcc', 'sn'
    32439: Type 'Utility' is enabled for Xenon modules,
           NOTE! This change needs NantToVSTools-3.15.00 or later versions to work properly.   

Changes:
    32443: Property xge.keep_going that controls whether Incredibuild XGE build stops on error or continues 
           was renamed to the "incredibuild.keep_going".
            
            incredibuild.keep_going controls both XGE (makefile) and IcredibuildConsole (sln) builds.

Bug Fixes:
    32323: DotNet framework 3.0 and 3.5 does not contain mscorlib.dll, System.dll and several 
           other assemblies in its folders.             
    32444: Enabled XGE makefile on PS3 support the case where 'generate-single-config' property is set to true.  
    28085: Fixed bug where assemblies file set in Initialize.xml overrides the build module constraint 
           NOTE! This change needs NantToVSTools-3.14.00 or later versions to work properly.   
    32311: Non-proxy versions of VisualStudio package do not contain SDK folder. tlbimp.exe in COM and web
           references code has to use WindowsSDK
           
Known Issues:

    32508: When  DotNet 3.5 in combination with 64 bit PC configuration is used failure may occur while building
           resource files using rc.exe:
            
               LINK : fatal error LNK1158: cannot run 'cvtres.exe'

           it looks like rc.exe tries to find cvtres.exe in the DotNet SDK directory, but .Net3.5 does not contain 
           this file. Adding known locations of  cvtres.exe to the PATH environment variable does not fix the problem.
           It seems that the only way is to copy cvtres.exe to the location where rc.exe expects it.

Details:
    
32323: When .Net 3.0 or higher is used mscorlib.dll, System.dll, etc are referenced without a path because 
       .Net folders do not contain these  DLLs. Compiler retrieves requred DLs from GAC. 
 
32439: Type 'Utility' is enabled for Xenon modules     
       In previous releases, if you had a Xenon module that is of 'Utility' type, the build would fail. 
       This behavior has been changed in this release. Now Xenon modules can have 'Utility' as their type. 
       However this type only supports pre/post build steps on Xenon. No custom build steps are supported. 
       A warning will be given if you specify custom build steps for a Xenon Utility module. 
       
       NOTE! This change needs NantToVSTools-3.15.00 or later versions to work properly. 
       
28085: Fixed bug where assemblies file set in Initialize.xml overrides the build module constraint        
       Only the specified modules should be referenced by the parent project. Modules not listed in
       ...runtime.buildmodules should not be referenced by the generated project even though the 
       initialize.xml script for the dependent package declares them in the 'package..assemblies' fileset. 
       This only applies to SLN builds. The inter-package build module constraint is not respected by native
       NAnt builds.
       
       NOTE! This change needs NantToVSTools-3.14.00 or later versions to work properly.   
       
32323: DotNet framework 3.0 and 3.5 does not contain mscorlib.dll, System.dll and several 
       other assemblies in its folders. 
       DotNet framework 3.0 and 3.5 does not contain mscorlib.dll, System.dll and several other 
       assemblies in its folders. These assemblies are located in GAC and compiler should be able
       to retrieve proper versions. eaconfig does not define an absolute path to these assemblies 
       for DotNet Framework 3.0 and 3.5      

EAConfig 1.29.01 Patch release Notes. Dec 11, 2008
---------------------------------------------

    32148: Fixed crash in solution generation occuring in some cases when moduleconstraint
           for dependencies between C# modules was defined    
Changes:
    32172: Add *.xdb to the build-copy-program target

New Features:
    31012: Changes in ps3-common.xml which allow PCLint integration
    31386: Added generic hook to define custom build targets
    31461: EXPERIMENTAL. Added new standard way to define debug level preprocessor directive globally
           or on per-package level
    31478: Added experimental support fror CygWin and MinGW configurations
Changes:
    29477: Added property to control whether vsimake will stop on failed target or continue 
            building other targets
    31470: Added XAudio2.lib to the list of default libraries for xenon    
Bug Fixes:
    30881: Fixed crash in SlnGenerator when a project has only dependencies and does not 
           define any filesets
    31482: Added support for ${groupname}.csproj.prebuildtarget    
Known Issues:
    28085: Assembly references should respect the buildmodules restrainst
           (<group>.<module>.<dependent>.runtime.buildmodules)
           
Details:
    
31386: Added generic hook to define custom build targets
    
    Description: Provides a custom build support to eaconfig so that build like tools can be integrated 
    into build in a clean way without involving unique changes on the eaconfig side. This was added for 
    current development in Novo regarding build auditing tools for checking warning suppression in builds
    but it is intended to be a way to hook in future tools like this without requiring further changes to
    eaconfig. Future PcLint and CodeWizard support may migrate to this custom build to remove the tool 
    specific support currently in eaconfig for them. This is an example of usage:
    
    <target name=" audit-warningoptions-task ">
        <!-- Do work here based on properties made available from the custom build properties. 
        They can be examined (for auditing the build), used as is or modified to be used with 
        a different build like tool
        Examples:
        custom-build.sourcefiles (fileset with all the source files that would be built in a standard build)
        custom-build.buildtype (property specifying the type of build)
        custom-build.ccdefines (property specifying the cc options that would be used in a standard build)
        -->
    </target>
    <target name="audit-warningoptions">
        <dependent name="gauntletprototype" />
        <dependent name="${package-name}"/>
        <nant buildfile="${package.${package-name}.dir}/${package-name}.build"
            target="build-custom"
            optionset="si-pass-nant-properties">
                <property name="custom-build.name" value="audit" />
                <property name="custom-build.includefile" value="${package.gauntletprototype.dir}/targets/auditwarningoptions-target.xml" />
                <property name="custom-build.target" value="audit-warningoptions-task" />
                <property name="gauntlet-policyfile-team" value="${gauntlet-policyfile-team}" />
                <property name="audit.useincredibuild" value="${audit.useincredibuild}" />
        </nant>
    </target>
    
    Below are the properties and options that eacofig defines before executing custom build target:
    
        <property name="custom-build.buildname" value="${build.outputname}" />
        <property name="custom-build.buildtype" value="CustomProgram" if="${build.buildtype.base} == 'StdProgram'" />
        <property name="custom-build.buildtype" value="CustomLibrary" if="${build.buildtype.base} == 'StdLibrary'" />
        <property name="custom-build.modulename" value="${build.module}"/>
        <property name="custom-build.outputdir" value="${package.builddir}/${config}/${custom-build.name}/${build.module}" />
        <fileset name="custom-build.asmsourcefiles" fromfileset="build.asmsourcefiles.all" />
        <fileset name="custom-build.sourcefiles" fromfileset="build.sourcefiles.all" />
        <property name="custom-build.asdefines" value="@{OptionSetGetValue('${build.buildtype}', 'as.defines')}${build.defines.all}"/>
        <property name="custom-build.ccdefines" value="@{OptionSetGetValue('${build.buildtype}', 'cc.defines')}${build.defines.all}"/>
        <property name="custom-build.asoptions" value="@{OptionSetGetValue('${build.buildtype}','as.options')}"/>
        <property name="custom-build.ccoptions" value="@{OptionSetGetValue('${build.buildtype}','cc.options')}"/>

31461: EXPERIMENTAL. Added new standard way to define debug level preprocessor directive globally or on per-package level        
    
    Description: New preprocessor definition is added by eaconfig if package.debuglevel or package.<packagename>.debuglevel
    properties are defined and only in debug configurations:
        <PACKAGENAME>_DEBUG=<debuglevel>
    Where <PACKAGENAME> is the name of the package converted to upper case and <debuglevel>=0 by default.
    To control <debuglevel> use following nant properties:
    
        "package.debuglevel" - to set debug level across all packages.
        "package.<packagename>.debuglevel" - to set debug level for individual package.
        
    "package.<packagename>.debuglevel" value takes precedence over "package.debuglevel" value.
    
    NOTE 1. These properties take effect only when 'debugflags' option equal to 'on' or 'custom', otherwise 
            debuglevel always set to 0.
    NOTE 2. debuglevel properties have to be declared as global properties in masterconfig file to work
            properly.
    NOTE 3. This feature is for C++ builds only.
    
31478: Added experimental support fror CygWin and MinGW configurations    
    
    Description: THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE.
    Added following new configurations:
        cyg-gcc-dev-debug
        cyg-gcc-dev-debug-opt
        cyg-gcc-dev-opt
        
    cyg-gcc-* is for Cygwin, for writing Unix apps with GCC that execute on Windows.
    
29477: Added property to control whether vsimake will stop on failed target or continue building other targets    

    Description: Added explicit option '--stop' to vsimake commandline for Incredibuild builds. 
    This option will force vsimake to stop after first failed target. 
    Added new eaconfig property to control vsimake behavior:
    
        xge.keep_going = true will result in vsimake continuing even after some target has failed. (--keep-going)
        xge.keep_going = false (or does not exist) will result in vsimake stop after some target has failed. (--stop)
        
31482: Added support for ${groupname}.csproj.prebuildtarget        

    Description: Solution generation flow was supporting per-package pre-generation targets defined by propertiy:
    ${groupname}.vcproj.prebuildtarget, but this functionality was missing for csharp projects. Now it is added.
    Set ${groupname}.csproj.prebuildtarget to the target name. This target will be executed before csproject generation.
    
Known Issues
-------------
28085: Assembly references should respect the buildmodules restrainst (<group>.<module>.<dependent>.runtime.buildmodules)

    Description: Only the specified modules should be referenced by the parent project. Modules not listed
    in ${<group>.<module>.<dependent>.runtime.buildmodules} should not be refenreced by the generated
    project even though the initialize.xml script for the dependent package declares them in the
    'package.<package>.assemblies' fileset
