This is a test of patch cancellation (rollback). It tests PatchBuilder's cancellation functionality. The expected directory at the end isn't a patched directory, it's the rolled back directory.

We have two directories here: local and expected. 
The local directory is a directory that that was presumably in the middle of being patched when the patch was cancelled. It has an incompleted patch installation that we will test rolling back.
The expected directory is the local directory should look like after the patch is rolled back.

The local directory was generated by running the PatchBuilder under a debugger and stopping the debugger at a chosen point.

The reason this directory has a name like cancelTest50 (ending in 50) is that the 5 indicates the PatchBuilderState, and the 0 means this is the first test of that state.
